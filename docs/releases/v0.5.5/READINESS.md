# v0.5.5 packaging checks

**Published October 18.** The [publication record](PUBLICATION.md) records completed checks and the owner's later cancellation of the remaining public verification. The requirements below describe the original packaging/publication plan.

The owner approved publishing #306's exact HU200 three-seed blend after review
and merge of the packaging change. Publication follows the verified draft and
public-download procedure in [v0.5.3's publication record](../v0.5.3/PUBLICATION.md).
The owner reviews and merges this package; publication then needs no second approval
if every declared check passes.

The fixed model is 6,282,968,150 bytes, SHA256
`ce3ecc2cb8ebffa1fb3e0a7f11c79d0900b74008b55d85093e1915ff4dde6485`,
with 156,208,331 entries, PR163 K50 tables and HU200 translation at 512 states /
128 events. The release uses the original audited average. Re-exports are
verification outputs only; there is no retraining, model replacement or selection.

Completed checks:

- The verified-cache runtime independently replays **30 retained hands**:
  16 human and 14 spectator, with no partial hands left. Actual browser controls
  exercised restricted sizing, an off-menu 800-chip raise, a 20,000-chip all-in,
  spectator Play/Pause/Step and a stable journal revision after Pause.
  Pending-bot-decision restart and idempotent acknowledgements pass.
  [Runtime receipt](verification/runtime.json).
- First start verifies, reassembles and builds the streaming cache in
  **1,214.93 seconds / 516,747,264 bytes peak process RSS**. A fresh later start
  verifies and maps it read-only in **80.96 seconds / 586,121,216 bytes**.
  All six cache arrays are verified against the pinned model and mapped read-only.
  The 9,331,096,671-byte cache and both timings are documented in the public
  install guide, model card and release notes. [Measurements](verification/cache-starts.json).
- Wrong valid model, rehashed K50 table and translation identity, wrong stack
  depth and inference adapter, mismatched cache model binding and a corrupted
  probability array are refused. Bad caches are reported and preserved, with
  instructions to move them aside and restart. Every injected fault is restored;
  the complete bundle, model and cache verify afterward.
- Runtime source coverage and the unchanged HU100 policy/translation modules are
  checked separately from native reconstruction. [Source coverage](verification/runtime-source-coverage.json).
- All four old HU100 manifests rebuild byte for byte; the old trace hashes stay
  equal, including a fresh v0.5.3 baseline comparison. All 1,280 trace hand records
  independently replay. The HU20 default remains v0.4.2.
  [Compatibility](verification/compatibility.json), [manifests](verification/old-manifests.json).
- Standalone stdlib verification passes for the blend and the separate collection
  of three averages **and three raw checkpoints**, with ordered parts at most
  1 GiB, pinned tables, recipe, identities and source/publication binding.
  Fresh bundles from clean source `ea5301bb` verify all **49 assets** and all six
  shipped documents byte for byte; both reject a wrong source and a request for
  publication approval. [Review-bundle receipt](verification/review-bundles.json).
  Two complete reconstructions from prepared parts reproduce all three averages
  and both exact audited blend hashes, including the integrated native readers.
  Completed outputs have source/copy/readback SHA256 verification and retained
  restoration provenance. The original release model is unchanged.
  [Reconstruction receipt](verification/reconstruction.json),
  [source coverage](verification/source-coverage.json).
- Public documentation includes protocol-v2 qualification, the failed first
  protocol, AIVAT context, internal results, weaknesses and measured requirements.
- Main and supplemental evidence archives pass whole-archive and every-member
  SHA256 readback. The deployed cache tool accepts their Drive size/MD5 and all
  6,874 main / 104 supplemental members' local CRC coverage. Canonical model
  restoration references, cache inventories and retained failures are explicit;
  all originals remain. [Archive pins and restoration](../../../RESULTS_INDEX.md#pr319--hu200-v055-release-packaging-verification).

Owner review and publication:

Final runtime code matches the verified-cache source `db0102c1`; native readers
and reconstruction code match `df9269c4`; all six shipped documents match the
verified `ea5301bb` review bundles byte for byte. The staged repository artifact
guard and green CI on the final PR commit are required before review hand-off.
The owner reviews and merges this PR. Publication always builds fresh approved
bundles from that merge commit; review bundles do not substitute for this step.

The separate research pre-release is `hu200-frozen-20b-seeds`, never Latest.
Publication requires the owner's packaging merge, publication-approved bundles,
green exact-merge CI, authenticated draft readbacks, unauthenticated public
readbacks of every asset and another full reconstruction from the downloaded
public seed parts. Release assets and raw runtime journals stay outside Git.
The earlier uncached runtime and its repaired spectator timer failure remain
recorded separately in [the historical receipt](verification/runtime-uncached.json).
