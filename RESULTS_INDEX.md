## PR346 — overnight three-player20BB campaign (complete; mixed results; archival pending)

**Verified complete October19 08:44:04UTC /10:44:04Madrid.** All three30B models pass export/every-row audits (328,640,906rows).

Read-only exact-result command:`ssh bb128 cat /tmp/nplayer-overnight-20261019-finish-noswap/results.json > FRESH_DESTINATION/source-results.json`, then verify the SHA256. Original/cache paths remain as below, exact final/anchor checkpoint/export paths and hashes in the model CSV/completion receipt. PR346 remains open; no new ZIP/Drive receipt exists, so archive/upload acceptance is pending. No deletion or cleanup.

[Proposal345](https://github.com/dberweger2017/CFR-NLHE-6max/issues/345); [frozen protocol](docs/nplayer-overnight-blueprint.md). The existing PR340~3B raw checkpoints/averages are read-only inputs. New owned tmpfs workspace `/tmp/nplayer-overnight-20261018` has retained, hash-verified copies in a new per-PR2TB cache root; exact [pins/root/launch receipts](docs/reports/nplayer-overnight/launch.md) record frozen source4cd199a5 and supervisor358105. Preserve all failures and partials. No originals deleted; cloud archival/acceptance pending.

October18 owner amendment requested Thermistor15 stop100°C after the next completed20B checkpoint, CPU90°C and the original deadline retained. **Terminal20:46:30UTC: old95°C guard stopped before20B, so100°C never activated. Last periodic progress17.47B;10B checkpoint retained, no further seed/final evaluation or automatic restart.** [Terminal receipt](docs/reports/nplayer-overnight/terminal-stop.md). Separate one-shot handoff code and `thermal-handoff-{armed,started,interruption,active,failure}.json` receipts live in the same owned run root; the interrupted stage and existing10B/20B checkpoints remain intact. The original frozen source/native binary are unchanged. `armed` is pending, not proof of activation; consult `active` and continuation measurements. No failed-science retry or recurring schedule.

**Recovery terminal October19 01:34:58UTC/03:34:58Madrid:** seeds1541/1542 completed30B with export/audit returncode0; seed1543 stopped near12.20B, with10B saved.

No final held-out evaluation or strength conclusion, no automatic restart; original deadline now passed. [Partial evidence and checkpoint hashes](docs/reports/nplayer-overnight/recovery-terminal.md).

Explicit subsequent owner recovery: [100°C recovery launch and setup-refusal provenance](docs/reports/nplayer-overnight/recovery100.md). Fresh root `bb128:/tmp/nplayer-overnight-20261018-resume100-v2`, supervisor371963; same10B input, frozen native binary and original deadline. Prior thermal failure and initial recovery setup refusal remain intact. Combined owned storage and absolute swap are charged to the original ceilings; no cleanup or cloud acceptance.

Reuse the two audited30B averages read-only; resume seed1543 from10B, then unchanged full final evaluation. No swap stop, CPU90°C/Thermistor15100°C; combined storage limits retained. Final traces go directly to the new owned HDD cache/evaluation path; no deletion/Drive acceptance.

## PR339 — N-player storage and parallel-save comparison (complete; archive pending)

[PR339](https://github.com/dberweger2017/CFR-NLHE-6max/pull/339),
[fixed protocol](docs/nplayer-storage-merge-benchmark.md),
[launch, source/toolchain/admission and setup failures](docs/reports/nplayer-storage-benchmark/launch.json).
The authorized comparison independently resumes the same PR292 three-player
checkpoint under baseline, PR331, and PR331+PR333 to 1.1B/1.2B/1.3B.
[Completed comparison](docs/reports/nplayer-storage-merge-benchmark.md):
all nine checkpoints match exactly; combined storage+saving takes11.20min
versus31.17min, with4.99× faster saves and58.9% less peak RSS. Recommend
#331+#333 together; the owner authorized and merged both on October18
(merge commits `ad3082433e` and `05f837c152`). No playing-strength claim.

- **Retained completed root:** `bb128:/home/dberweger/nplayer-storage-benchmark-20261018-v2/`;
  supervisor PID213705 admitted October18 at09:10:07UTC. Sources, patches,
  source manifest (141 file hashes), binaries, configuration, raw logs/resource
  traces and checkpoints remain there. All three builds, 42/44/44 native library tests, and fresh/resume
  identity fixtures passed. The baseline large-checkpoint arm started loading
  by09:13:15UTC. Source freeze `ce6a3b5a`. All three main arms exited0;

  [Exact rows/totals](docs/reports/nplayer-storage-benchmark/summary.json),
  [completion/source/resource receipt](docs/reports/nplayer-storage-benchmark/completion.json).
- **Preserved setup:** `bb128:/home/dberweger/nplayer-storage-benchmark-20261018/`.
  Initial lock refusal launched no workload. Later baseline/compact library
  checks passed, but the PR333 harness failed to compile because its save API
  requires a gzip argument. No 1B continuation ran. The fresh corrected setup
  selects `Gzip::Compatible`; the adapter is recorded in its source manifest.
- **Read-only input:** retained PR292 member `training/2026101541/1000m.gz`,
  1,199,517,402 bytes, SHA256
  `262334b77373c7f418078861ea57fbce181d126c5dda032aa2ff22758a876f21`.
  Its original source mtime matches the recorded member. Native loading verifies
  SHA256 before every arm. PR292 is merged; its root is not modified.
  [Accepted archive/member provenance](docs/reports/nplayer-blueprint-phase2-artifacts/archive-model-members.json)
  and the PR292 entry below provide Drive restoration links and commands.
- **Retrieve retained evidence:** copy only the needed files from the retained
  root into a fresh ignored directory with
  `scp -r bb128:/home/dberweger/nplayer-storage-benchmark-20261018-v2/measurements FRESH_DESTINATION/`.
  Input retrieval remains through PR292's accepted archive; verify the pinned
  SHA256 after retrieval. Own run archival to Research-Cloud is pending;
  PR339 remains open and its roots are protected. The benchmark released
  its mutex; another holder had acquired it at final validation. No large
  archive/copy/upload was started, and no upload acceptance or deletion is
  claimed. Preserve both roots.

## PR330 — v0.5.5 confirmation: card luck and public-action diagnosis

[PR330](https://github.com/dberweger2017/CFR-NLHE-6max/pull/330); [report](docs/reports/v055-confirmation-diagnostics.md), [reproduction commands](docs/reports/v055-confirmation-diagnostics/REPRODUCE.md), [complete storage/input/member receipt](docs/reports/v055-confirmation-diagnostics/storage.json). Calculation/result freeze `fc19783d390c9850130b3d664667695ee7489fb6`: 30,000 new card-only per-hand corrections and public-action diagnosis over 70,000 distinct completed hands. No play, training, model computation or own-action correction. Protocol v2's raw qualification stands.

- **Drive folder:** [PR-330-v055-confirmation-diagnostics](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ueATVOG6U3hgyjP5eKiMQfp4LW4nYrtW). Uncompressed cache: `bb128:/research/PR-330-v055-confirmation-diagnostics/` (resolved `/mnt/data2tb/research-cloud/PR-330-v055-confirmation-diagnostics/`). Raw journals, historical/new per-hand data, source ZIPs, source export, summaries, charts, tables, failures and reproduction logs remain there. No originals were removed.
- **Main archive:** `gdrive:PR-330-v055-confirmation-diagnostics/v055-confirmation-diagnostics-20261017.zip`, **77,186,931 bytes**, SHA256 `b8a19db561a5c8255968356a08d7c90ae3aa502d57495934f7748993c1cd5668`, Drive MD5 `1497f2d536f5b5bd051ff11d2b34ea28`, file ID `1AvXlWYatfU7Pic1jLHJmeeIIEuLpVUdH`. Embedded `ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json` SHA256 `ba7a00c8c634958a1dedafea77e3a9acfc29388668e0cd2eb7bed0e1818c2e29`; all 400 payload members read back and match uncompressed SHA256s.
- **Complementary closeout archive:** `v055-confirmation-diagnostics-closeout-20261017.zip`, **11,224 bytes**, SHA256 `6c44aef485abcdf04bd69452bb0115617f73c7aef61caef5fe4ab28b1e039502`, Drive MD5 `efe1d7d07bed9ab4401d3e4423c38334`, file ID `1BVqop1jQck1e2EJw28J1vVWH9sziVcsf`. Embedded manifest SHA256 `20abaf1ee18c19a658ed1801393224a77a356dc796cedab4b9bf05e6c49bc524`; all 11 payload members read back. It supplies the three `inputs/pr{318,304,316}/ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json` files skipped by the main builder and preserves upload plumbing logs/fixes. Its root manifest also has an identical `closeout/ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json` member.
- **Acceptance:** both uploaded from the cache with deployed `research_cache.py upload`, using the resolved ZIP path after the deployed symlink-path receipt error. `.drive-receipt.json` covers **414/414 files**, zero uncovered/changed. Independent Drive metadata matches each ZIP's MD5/size and file ID; this is not a remote SHA256/member audit or redownload. Failures, recovered startup/transfer problems, input-prefix provenance and the final folder-ID metadata correction are retained in the linked receipt and archive logs.
- **Required inputs:** the three original source ZIPs at `inputs/` retain #318/#304/#316's indexed whole SHA256s, with uncompressed `inputs/pr318/`, `inputs/pr304/`, `inputs/pr316/`. The two exploratory journals are `inputs/exploratory/prefix/journal.jsonl` and `inputs/exploratory/part2/journal.jsonl`. Exact archive/member/journal pins are in the linked receipt; all eleven chains verified before use. New data: `outputs/m1/perhand-confirmation-{a,b,c,pooled}.jsonl`; historical data: `inputs/pr316/perhand-*.jsonl`. No model is a restoration dependency.
- **Restore:** copy the uncompressed cache into a fresh destination with `scp -r bb128:/research/PR-330-v055-confirmation-diagnostics/ FRESH_DESTINATION/`. Drive fallback: `rclone copy gdrive:PR-330-v055-confirmation-diagnostics/ FRESH_DESTINATION/`; verify both whole ZIP SHA256s and manifests, then extract the main ZIP followed by the closeout ZIP with `unzip -n` in that fresh destination. This preserves the main root manifest and restores the separate closeout manifest. Follow `source/final/docs/reports/v055-confirmation-diagnostics/REPRODUCE.md`; verify required members before use. Never overwrite active inputs.

## PR319 — HU200 v0.5.5 release packaging verification

[Packaging PR](https://github.com/dberweger2017/CFR-NLHE-6max/pull/319),
[readiness and compact receipts](docs/releases/v0.5.5/READINESS.md).
Verified-cache runtime: 30 independently replayed hands, first/reused startup,
refusal and restart checks. Two full prepared-part reconstructions reproduce
all three seed averages and the exact `59a6dd35…` raw / `ce3ecc2c…` average blend.
Scientific source/model remains #306's audited blend. Tested runtime source
`db0102c1`, integrated reconstruction `df9269c4`, fresh 49-asset review bundles
`ea5301bb`; later changes only record evidence. Released October 18 from merge
`ef0e3a41aee720a220520c10bb248740ae7a7154`: all 49 authenticated asset readbacks
and all 15 stable public-URL hashes pass. The owner cancelled the remaining
post-publication checks and reconstruction from public seed parts.
[Publication record, asset IDs and verification scope](docs/releases/v0.5.5/PUBLICATION.md).
The original packaging evidence below remains unchanged.

Main embedded `ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json`: SHA256
`2eec44706d11fc75ffdd1f88cbd88918c2ef8c12703b115f9235a73c001c792d`.

`94b32e3f02633b78034bb8e7353478a63c76936888794223050e17c5688fafeb`.
Every member's bytes/SHA256 read back locally; the unchanged deployed cache tool
accepts Drive size/MD5 and local CRC coverage for **6,874 main / 104 supplemental
members**, including manifests. Drive MD5 acceptance is not a remote SHA256 audit.
Immutable local-verification receipts are also uploaded:
[main](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iuCg85iyXVlwhQikQyLOkdrw3ErOeT9M/view)
(588 bytes, MD5 `b3b4f8a0751c70b500be50f3b358e66d`) and
[supplement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kGPpSr1aI-OFyTI6ZCCmbiGgcrrKHviP/view)
(549 bytes, MD5 `a9b5dc24b9cdebd3295eb7b17df19a61`).
Their pre-upload local status remains unchanged; separate cloud-acceptance records
and `.drive-receipt.json` record accepted uploads.

### October 18 publication and cancellation evidence

The following additional archives are accepted in the same Drive/cache root.
The owner cancelled the remaining public checks after the stable release's 15
asset hashes passed; the incomplete public standalone run, closed guard,
completed results and cancellation receipt are retained. The public seed rebuild
never started. Downloaded release binaries remain separate from research ZIPs.
All originals remain; no cleanup or complete-folder coverage is claimed.

Every member was read back locally by size/SHA256. The unchanged deployed cache
tool accepted Drive object size/MD5 and the corresponding uncompressed local
member CRC coverage; this is not a remote SHA256/member audit. The manifests,
ZIPs and selected members remain immutable. The publication metadata includes
exact-source CI, tag/Latest/release metadata, all asset IDs and worker sources.
The cancellation archive includes `publication-ef0e3a41/owner-verification-cancelled.json`,
`publication-ef0e3a41/public-readbacks/`, the closed public download logs and the
closed v3 guard log. An empty public standalone output is retained as unfinished;
it is not a pass. Details specific to machines and operations stay in PR #319
and the evidence.

**Retrieve:** copy the named uncompressed members from
`/research/PR-319-HU200-v055-release-package/` to a fresh ignored destination.
Drive fallback: `rclone copy gdrive:PR-319-HU200-v055-release-package/ FRESH_DESTINATION/`;
verify the selected ZIP and embedded manifest SHA256s above, extract into that
fresh destination and check required member hashes. No Drive access is required
to reconstruct the frozen blend from the separate public GitHub seed pre-release.

All uncompressed evidence remains at
`/research/PR-319-HU200-v055-release-package/`, with `KEEP` and all originals retained.
Main members include journals, independent audits, refusal/failure evidence,
source/tool snapshots, input/retrieval provenance and unique partials. The
supplement adds fresh review-bundle proof, byte-identical shipped-doc snapshots,
later administrative notes, closed guard/upload logs and the retained receipt-path
failure plus its receipt-only repair. No deployed tool or archive bytes changed.
The 22 identical model copies were freshly SHA256-checked before exclusion; their
accepted canonical archives, member paths, bytes/hashes and commands are in main
member `canonical-model-restoration.json` and `indexed-model-exclusions.json`.
These include average `ce3ecc2c…` / raw `59a6dd35…` blend pins and all six seed pins.
Derived play/native build caches have inventories and regeneration provenance;
local app tokens are excluded. Release assets are separate. This is intentionally
not complete-folder coverage or permission to evict/delete.

**Retrieve from cache:** copy named uncompressed members from that cache root to
a fresh ignored working directory and verify their indexed SHA256 before use.
**Drive fallback:** `rclone copy gdrive:PR-319-HU200-v055-release-package/ DEST`,
verify the ZIP/manifest pins above, then extract into a fresh directory and verify
required member hashes. For an excluded model, use its exact canonical archive
and member from `canonical-model-restoration.json` (also indexed under #306 and
its input proofs), verify those archive/manifest pins, extract and check the model
SHA256. Never overwrite active inputs. Full failures, guards and plumbing notes
remain in the PR and archived evidence.

## PR318 — v0.5.5 confirmation (protocol version 2): the blend qualifies

## PR316 — AIVAT on real Slumbot hands

Per-hand AIVAT corrections and analyzer summaries for #304's three runs and the v0.5.5 blend's exploratory run, behind [the report](docs/reports/slumbot-aivat-real-runs.md) and its charts.

- **Archive:** `gdrive:PR-316-slumbot-aivat-real-runs/slumbot-aivat-real-runs-perhand-20261017.zip`, **2,062,452 bytes**, SHA256 `51a525a617eb90c83d746e6bfd26347fa47f93774b3d379c172a4e091ca298ee`, Drive MD5 `e769f9873de0fbf2df0d60f446966d1f`, Drive ID `1uB46WMr3kTdEVJbjc79HVdeFEtNVWCAf`.

- **Restore:** `rclone copy gdrive:PR-316-slumbot-aivat-real-runs/ DEST`.
- **Inputs:** #304's journals are in PR304's archive. The blend run's journals are on cygnus-x1 under `~/slumbot-blend/runs/`.

## PR306 — frozen HU200 three-seed blend run

[PR306](https://github.com/dberweger2017/CFR-NLHE-6max/pull/306), completed fixed study;
[report](docs/reports/hu200-v055-blend-run.md). Owner-authorized October 16
continuation of merged #297's unplayed frozen campaign. All three original averages freshly reproduce exactly from their raw checkpoints on the 16 GiB M4. The single 156,208,331-key blend passes every-row audit. All fixed final counts run: 2,162,688 stored primary records replay/reproduce, and repeated blend fingerprints match before readout. No direct gain is established; all 21 paired scripted intervals include zero. The blend still loses 1.5× pot pressure, −29.39 [−55.24,−3.53] BB/100, retained as failed adverse research evidence without retry or tuning. Peak sampled family RSS is 12.75 GB. Main, input and administrative Drive acceptance and requested whole-archive/member-verified unpacked 2 TB retention are complete. Original clock/time-stop and prospectively authorized extension are preserved, with unchanged guard state. [Complete readout](docs/reports/hu200-v055-blend-run-artifacts/summary.json), [global barrier](docs/reports/hu200-v055-blend-run-artifacts/all-final-verified.json).

[unpacked retention](docs/reports/hu200-v055-blend-run-artifacts/main-archive-unpacked-retention.json).
Creation-time nested `cloud_upload_accepted:false` receipts precede the separate
successful upload acceptance; acceptance-time `remote_archive_bytes_downloaded:false`
precedes the later successful bb128 Drive-body download and readback.

Model members are `research/hu200-v055-blend/merge/average.gz`,
`research/hu200-v055-blend/merge/checkpoint.gz`, and
`research/hu200-v055-blend/merge/current.gz`, with the sizes/SHA256s above.
The archive contains all raw comparison traces, independent replay/reproduction
receipts, global fingerprints, source/configuration, failures and the readable
report snapshot. Canonical inputs/tables are excluded only after hash checks
and remain indexed dependencies. The accepted administrative supplement retains the
closed live-archive guard and final resource/upload/unpacked-retention evidence.
No research original is removed.

Retrieve the average directly from the unpacked cache, into a fresh ignored
directory on M4 before any further authorized research:

```sh
mkdir results/retrieved/pr306-blend-hdd-NEW
rsync -a bb128:/research/PR-306-HU200-v055-blend-run/hu200-v055-blend-run-M4-20261016/research/hu200-v055-blend/merge/average.gz results/retrieved/pr306-blend-hdd-NEW/
shasum -a 256 results/retrieved/pr306-blend-hdd-NEW/average.gz
```

Require **6,282,968,150 bytes** and SHA256
`ce3ecc2cb8ebffa1fb3e0a7f11c79d0900b74008b55d85093e1915ff4dde6485`.
The always-available Drive path, including after cache eviction, is:

```sh
mkdir results/retrieved/pr306-blend-drive-NEW
rclone copyto --immutable --drive-root-folder-id 1FZiDigTX-_Do4pPihTF4pdZTDaxNRxPK gdrive:hu200-v055-blend-run-M4-20261016.zip results/retrieved/pr306-blend-drive-NEW/hu200-v055-blend-run-M4-20261016.zip
shasum -a 256 results/retrieved/pr306-blend-drive-NEW/hu200-v055-blend-run-M4-20261016.zip
```

Require the whole-archive size/SHA256 above before opening the ZIP. Read
`ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json` and require its pinned SHA256; extract only the needed
member into a fresh ignored destination and require its pinned bytes/SHA256
before use. For the raw checkpoint or auditor current export, substitute the
exact corresponding member and pins above. The cached manifest at the unpacked
root provides every other source/trace member's bytes and SHA256.

Require the indexed archive bytes/SHA256 and embedded manifest SHA256 before
extracting; validate extracted members against that manifest. With the cached
copy, validate its `ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json` hash and every needed member directly.

## M1-prioritized cleanup — October 16 afternoon

Owner-requested cleanup retired **40 M1 paths /16 unique inodes**, representing
**14,747,889,664 allocated bytes (14.748 GB upper bound)**, and **four M4 paths /
4,693,065,728 allocated bytes (4.693 GB)**. Free space at the final pass checks:
**M1 16.855 GB /M4 57.727 GB**; other activity changes these readings.
M1 removed completed release/package/probe copies, one redundant retrieved ZIP
and one redundant table; M4 removed four redundant PR211 pilot-model copies.
Canonical inputs, small scientific/failure records, shared Git and open
PR301/306/314 dependencies remain. Nothing inside synced Drive was deleted or
offloaded. Current PR312/313 storage/contributor changes were checked first;
the live cache tool and cron were not changed.

[Exact paths, preservation, administrative failures and restoration](docs/artifacts/storage-cleanup-afternoon-20261016.md).
[Full receipt ZIP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vEmYHa3c63-YWoWFCuuE81JlmWEsUJSm/view),
**84,338 bytes**, SHA256
`c369b620fafaf3c7f9ef6d1f7fa8c19d83f4cbdd13041c6c3db53e4c6193e0cb`,

`acd9f514549dac787c84fb9dcb2e1ce710222454062c8c957f8c13cb1397ed07`.
All 18 members passed readback. The bb128-only immutable upload accepted Drive
MD5/size and all 19 local files are covered by `.drive-receipt.json`.
Uncompressed cache: `/research/PR-315-storage-cleanup-afternoon-20261016/`.
Always restore with `rclone copy gdrive:PR-315-storage-cleanup-afternoon-20261016/ FRESH_DIRECTORY`,
then verify the ZIP/manifest and read `evidence/complete-receipt.json`.

## Research storage policy — owner-approved October 16, 2026

**Google Drive holds all research files long-term.** The only new-upload route is
bb128's fast HDD cache at `/research/PR-<n>-<name>/` (owner symlink to
`/mnt/data2tb/research-cloud`; use that real path until the symlink exists).
`gdrive:` is rooted at [deepcfr-research-results](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/188bEt6i0RHqegCCdvpf3wPzUiRw78N2s),
so the same per-PR name maps to the Macs' Research-Cloud. Mac synced Drive folders
are now **read-only**: fetch missing material and copy it out; never write/delete
inside them. Prefer restoring through bb128 so the cache fills. The often-away
M1 can continue fetching through Drive. Active work stays on NVMe.

Keep an **uncompressed** final cache copy with the ZIP's folder structure; upload
from bb128 with `/research/.tools/research_cache.py upload 'PR-<n>-<name>' ZIP`.
`receipt` verifies files already uploaded; `.drive-receipt.json` records Drive
ID/MD5/size and local member size/CRC32 coverage. `status` lists cache folders.
Every archive entry must record owning PR/source/run, Drive file ID/path,
MD5, archive bytes/SHA256, manifest path/SHA256/readback, coverage, failures,
required model/input member SHA256s, and both retrieval paths:

- Cached: `/research/PR-<n>-<name>/` while retained.
- Always available: `rclone copy 'gdrive:PR-<n>-<name>/' '/research/PR-<n>-<name>/'`,
  then verify the archive/manifest/member hashes and extract the needed files.

The owner authorized the existing **04:00 daily cache-only eviction**: seven
unused days, all files covered/unchanged, matching live Drive size/MD5 and local
content reread without updating atime, no open PR/KEEP/open process. GitHub-list
failure aborts all eviction/purge. Evicted data spends another seven days in
`/research/.evicted/`, timed by its name stamp; restore it locally during that
window, or from Drive afterward. Decisions are logged in
`/research/.eviction-log.jsonl` with available Drive IDs and restore commands.
This is the sole unattended-cleanup exception; NVMe/Mac original retention stays.

[Full storage contract](docs/artifact-storage.md), [deployed README copy](docs/research-cache-deployed-readme.md),
[tool import hashes and review findings](docs/artifacts/research-cache-import-20261016.md).
Repository fixes are not deployed without owner review/approval. Existing PR301,
PR306 and other already running campaigns keep their current method to completion.
The planned private M4↔bb128 cable is not assumed working. Only one large upload
at a time, without Slumbot competition. Credentials never enter evidence; no
rclone operation may delete/change Drive. Old Mac/native acceptance records below
are historical receipts, not authorization for new Mac uploads.

## M4 storage for open PR306 — October 16, 2026

Owner-prioritized cleanup removed 17 unchanged inactive HU100 input/model copies
from merged PR246/251/254/260: **13.923 GB actual free-space increase**, leaving
**93.812 GB free** at verification while PR306 restoration/export continued.
All HU200 and open PR inputs remain. [Scope and restoration](docs/artifacts/m4-pr306-headroom-20261016.md),
[exact per-path receipt](docs/artifacts/m4-pr306-headroom-20261016.json).

parent `188bEt6i0RHqegCCdvpf3wPzUiRw78N2s`. Existing archive/member proofs,
current native and independent cloud confirmation were reused without payload
re-downloads/hash audits; eight protected input pins remained unchanged.

## Storage cleanup — October 16, 2026

Owner-requested post-merge cleanup retires **49 paths /48 unique inodes** from
merged PR297/298. Measured free-space increases: **M1 6.527 GB /M4 19.408 GB**;
free immediately after: **17.459 GB /83.394 GB**. Canonical publication models,
assets and tables, PR292 archival dependencies and active PR301 roots/transfers, failed PR278 seed1421 full
archive dependencies, shared Git and synced files remain.

[Scope, exact restoration sources and verification](docs/artifacts/storage-vacuum-20261016.md).
[Complete per-path receipt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z_XSRBqoRzIDgxz3NMFr1lOJWH-TfRhs/view?usp=drivesdk):

parent `188bEt6i0RHqegCCdvpf3wPzUiRw78N2s`. Current native upload acceptance
and independent cloud ID/name/size/parent agree. Existing manifests/input proofs
and unchanged source metadata were used without research-payload re-downloads
or repeated hash audits; 267 retained files verify unchanged.

## PR304 — v0.5.5 Slumbot confirmation (two seeds pass, 2026101302 fails)

Archive `~/Local/Research-Cloud/PR-304-HU200-v055-slumbot-confirmation/hu200-v055-slumbot-confirmation-20261015.zip`, **15,256,156 bytes**, SHA256 `51f4587dc3fec12a65537be51e27572c3f1eec147952c8ed383f1c7689c57137`; embedded `ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json` SHA256 `4c3d53ca809f9b03715aa0a3adb0edbfca5b1da32d822efc589baf3f83f35e1a`. All 25 members were read back against the manifest before copying:
- `v055-runs/seed-2026101302-*/` and `v055-runs-pr278/seed-202610142{1,2}-*/`: the six journals (part 1 and part 2 per seed) and five `summary.json` files. Seed 2026101422's part 1 ended without a summary.
- `analysis/v055/`: the three pooled 10,000-hand analyses, also in [the report's folder](docs/reports/hu200-v055-slumbot-confirmation/).
- `run-v055-seed-*.sh`: the six launchers; `translation-runs-pr271/*/summary.json`: the October 14 exploratory runs of the same frozen 20B model; `repo-v055-part2-HEAD.txt`: the part-2 commit `98658f7`.

Restore with `python3 -m zipfile -e ARCHIVE results/retrieved/pr304` and check the manifest; reproduce each row with `python -m scripts.analyze_slumbot_run PART1 PART2 --hands 10000 --out pooled.json` (models, caches and tables are pinned in [#278's index](docs/reports/hu200-v055-confirmation.md)). Journals name the Slumbot account only; no tokens or credentials. Copied into the synced folder with its local hash verified; Drive upload acceptance was not separately checked. Originals are kept on db-ocean in `~/deepcfr-slumbot/` and on the M1 in `~/Local/v055-slumbot-confirmation/`.

## PR292 — Three-player full-average blueprint (merged; cloud archive complete)

[PR292](https://github.com/dberweger2017/CFR-NLHE-6max/pull/292), branch
`feature/nplayer-blueprint-phase2`; [protocol](docs/nplayer-blueprint-phase2-protocol.md),
[report](docs/reports/nplayer-blueprint-phase2.md). Fresh sequential cash seeds
2026101541–1543, all-street averages, scheduled 200M/500M/1B endpoints. Harness
qualification passes; all three seeds reached 1B nodes with all nine scheduled
checkpoint/export/every-row-audit endpoints and whole-seed guards passing.
Final tables contain 29,025,056 /29,370,052 /29,668,448 entries. Exact admissions,
checkpoint/export SHA256s and per-street coverage are recorded in the
[per-seed receipts](docs/reports/nplayer-blueprint-phase2-artifacts/).
Final regression closeout and all 42 final comparisons passed. Every one of
2,064,384 final hands replayed and exactly reproduced before verified readout.
The learning rule passes on all three seeds; [full results and intervals](docs/reports/nplayer-blueprint-phase2.md).

`/mnt/data2tb/research-cloud/PR-292-nplayer-blueprint-phase2/main-evidence.zip.part0117-0`; its direct MD5 check/Drive ID are in the final receipt.

**Cleanup deferred; all scientific originals and host archives/parts retained.**
Dependency inspection was denied for five owned bb128 processes, so the
pre-removal helper stopped and no removal ran. Active inputs, shared Git,
environments, PR291 smoke and #283 tables remain. Disposable accepted Mac
transport buffers alone were retired with archived regeneration/removal logs.
The earlier [133-piece partial index](docs/reports/nplayer-blueprint-phase2-artifacts/archive-main-cloud-partial.json)
and [restart/bridge block](docs/reports/nplayer-blueprint-phase2-artifacts/archive-transport-block.json)
remain historical evidence, superseded for current acceptance by the final index.
[The original handoff](docs/artifacts/pr292-archive-cleanup-handoff.md) points to
this completed closeout. No scientific retry, recurring schedule or M4 access.

## PR297 — frozen HU200 v0.5.5 blend, raw-input continuation

`33215e6b`, qualified scientific source `24df6228`. **Final capacity stop /no playing result.**
All three raw checkpoint SHA256s verify and all released average SHA256s
reproduce exactly. The union contains **156,208,331 keys**: 88,880,705 in one

a **11,141,362,646-byte shortfall**. Only the fixed unplayed compression probe
exists; no full blend, cache build, pilot or final hand runs. The original
normalized-export stop is preserved separately. The M4 releases October16 at
**01:19:22 Madrid /October15,23:19:22UTC**, both locks free,63.30GB available.

`research/hu200-v055-blend/` contains input proofs, source-cache receipts,
raw resources/failures, union/probe/audit/gate and stop summary;
`research/hu200-v055-blend-{inputs,tooling,tooling-post-review,python-tests,qualified-tools}/`
preserves earlier proof/build/check histories. `control/`, `source/` and
`bin/hu200_blend` preserve exact implementation. The M1 administrative ZIP preserves the closed
M4 archive guard, release and primary-upload receipts, plus report/source metadata;
[admin readback](docs/reports/hu200-v055-blend-artifacts/continuation-admin-archive-receipt.json) and
[admin upload acceptance](docs/reports/hu200-v055-blend-artifacts/continuation-admin-upload-acceptance.json).
The final M1 supplement also preserves the administrative import failure,
its unchanged-function correction, main-integration/conflict resolution and
acceptance of the two earlier ZIPs.
[Final supplement readback](docs/reports/hu200-v055-blend-artifacts/continuation-admin-final-archive-receipt.json) and
[final supplement acceptance](docs/reports/hu200-v055-blend-artifacts/continuation-admin-final-upload-acceptance.json).
Its own final native/cloud observations remain as compact Git receipts, avoiding
recursive archival. No model/hand payload is processed on M1.
Indexed canonical input files
are excluded after SHA256 verification and retained locally; their retrieval
links below remain dependencies. No full blended player is claimed.

expanded setup-failure summary under `receipts/`. All originals remain.

## PR298 — M1 v0.5.3 package prepared for owner review

[PR298](https://github.com/dberweger2017/CFR-NLHE-6max/pull/298),
[readiness](docs/releases/v0.5.3/READINESS.md),
[science](docs/reports/hu100-v053-translation.md).
**PR298 merged October 15.** The nonsynced M1 checkout
`~/Local/hu100-v053-release-package/`, canonical models/tables and publication
assets remain. The [October 16 cleanup](docs/artifacts/storage-vacuum-20261016.md)
retired 44 archived-evidence/redundant-copy paths with exact restoration receipts.
That cleanup performs no release, tag, publication or default change.
Candidate: PR272 original seed 2026100601, declared without selection;
verified average 3,196,291,551 bytes, SHA256
`c3a8edc4cc78098f07ac3e4ecbbb3dacae298a266b9fcd5fc788d0e2b6fcfc8e`.
The task’s initial size was the earlier parent’s; no candidate substitution.
Scientific source `3bfabb9d1d46f95544826f602686292acc2b538a`, canonical plan SHA256
`a2eec9a4ca9499f63df906ef61c8bcb4b205b410e2d65d99e9f994ea253cc5b4`.

All 720,896 original final hands replay/reproduce before readout. Seven paired
contrasts 0.00 [0.00,0.00] BB/100 pass the declared safeguard; fresh descriptive
direct +37.10 [30.16,44.04] BB/100. No v2 witness selected in this scientific
panel; random’s off-menu all-ins retain uniform fallback. All three real
v0.5.0–v0.5.2 trace hashes and old manifests match. Actual M1 smoke, every retained
failed/successful-attempt journal including the partial hand, and wrong
model/table/identity refusals verify. [Runtime/audit receipts](docs/releases/v0.5.3/READINESS.md).

Final 12 assets: `results/v053-release-package/assets/` in that checkout,
clean package source `ffa9ff7d9b68cd96c9cec218088f5a62fc6dcca2`; later integration/docs retain tested bytes.
[Every asset’s bytes/hash](docs/releases/v0.5.3/verification/asset-inventory.json).
Three parts plus K50 tables; fresh stdlib-only whole-model reassembly verifies.

Raw hands/decisions and full reproductions, sources, resource traces, partials,
all failures and restoration/rebuild provenance are retained in:

Each embedded member manifest is `ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json`; every local member’s
size/SHA256 read back. Native uploaded=1, uploading=0, no pause/conflicts/trash,
exact document size and independent cloud ID/name/size/parent match establish
separate upload acceptance. **Remote archive bytes were not downloaded.**
The lifecycle ZIP closes the evidence archive guard and acceptance records;
its own final guard observations/acceptance are preserved in the compact Git
[closing receipt](docs/releases/v0.5.3/verification/archive-lifecycle-closing.json), avoiding a recursive archive. The exact ZIP backup made before native-client recovery remains. The later
October 16 cleanup retires only the explicitly receipted originals/copies.

Original#286 pilots/training/nine-comparison failures and raw evidence remain
in its already accepted archives; no original archive was re-audited for cleanup.

**M4 released15:10:38UTC /17:10:38CEST October15:** all owned scientific/archival
workers exited, both locks verified free,56.51GiB free. This was posted and read
back in the PR, alongside revised PR closeout ETA15:45UTC /17:45CEST; actual
merge remains the owner’s decision. No further research/archival CPU, background
schedule, release, tag or default change is authorized by this closeout.

## Merged PR286 storage retirement — October 15, 13:45 UTC

Owner-requested cleanup after current merged-status/upload/dependency review
reclaims **50.124 GB** on M4: eight unchanged archived training/model originals
**28.261 GB** and two accepted model ZIP caches **21.863 GB**. Verified
**78.787 GB free**. This supersedes earlier local-original retention only for
the eight exact paths; their final averages/checkpoints/current exports remain
restorable through four accepted model/average Drive archives.

No payload download/repeated hashes, synced deletion/force/unpin, process signal,
scientific readout/retry or unattended work.

## M4 uploaded-cache supplement — October 15, 12:42 UTC

Another **10.593 GB** released normally from five confirmed uploaded unused ZIP

Normal native per-file eviction only; no forced offload/unpin/synced deletion,
active original retirement, repeated payload hashes or unattended cleanup.

## M4 evidence-closeout space — October 15 afternoon

Owner-requested cleanup reclaims **18.235 GB**: six unchanged archived inactive
HU200 model copies (17.343 GB), six unused Rust debug caches and pip downloads
(0.891 GB). M4 has **40.041 GB /37.291 GiB free** at 12:33:12 UTC.
All current PR286 model/input/table/evidence/policy-cache paths and PR292 work
remain; server copies are intact. Earlier local-retention notes are superseded
only for the six named copies. Seed1 full retry is missing/unaccepted; its
checkpoints/current export and failed canonical/Lost and Found stay.
[Exact model/archive/member hashes, source-history checks and rebuilds](docs/artifacts/storage-vacuum-20261015-closeout.md);

[Owner-requested Vacuum Cleaner Bot comment](https://github.com/dberweger2017/CFR-NLHE-6max/pull/286#issuecomment-6192153333) confirms
headroom for archival closeout, with no change to the scientific stop/retry.

## PR291 — N-player size measurements and bounded smoke (owner-reviewed, October 15, 2026)

[PR291](https://github.com/dberweger2017/CFR-NLHE-6max/pull/291), branch
`feature/nplayer-size-smoke`; [report](docs/reports/nplayer-size-smoke.md),
[protocol](docs/nplayer-size-smoke-protocol.md). The owner cleared the independent
PR289 review at `5df55c52` before these dependent measurements. Size study
source `78954644`; export/loader native implementation `0e836e52`; fixed smoke
runner `cdd8959a`. Full source, binary and input pins are in the report receipts.

**Protected working evidence, not an accepted cloud archive:**
`bb128:/home/dberweger/nplayer-size-smoke-20261015/`. Retain the complete root:
pilot/main size measurements, commands/logs/watchdog resources, source bundles,
key-compatibility checkpoints, policy fixtures, the fixed smoke's fresh/prefix/
resumed checkpoints, scoped-average export and privileged replay traces,
independent audits, regression payloads and all setup/failure evidence.
Compact receipts and the growth figure live in
`docs/reports/nplayer-size-smoke-artifacts/`. Generated checkpoint/policy/trace
payloads are not committed. Cloud archival/upload acceptance and cleanup remain
pending; no original has been removed. A transport ref-name error before the
small audit test was corrected before any compute; it did not rerun an experiment.

For a needed model, copy its receipt-named path into a fresh ignored directory,
for example `rsync -a bb128:/home/dberweger/nplayer-size-smoke-20261015/smoke/scoped-average.gz results/nplayer-smoke/`,
and verify its full SHA256 against the smoke result before use. This is host
retrieval, not cloud restoration. The policy explicitly combines a preflop
average with postflop current regret matching; it is not a released model.
The completed 200,000,154-node smoke has a 335,278,630-byte fresh/resumed
checkpoint, SHA256 `2bfe844a2bba1161b354bc5d7af721221786a23a57d775447cf8ede2fcc33b4a`.
Its 225,158,368-byte scoped export has SHA256
`fcbe8bd5733572fe9f9046840d6e277a0b11ce0ac96936546df0815be218485e`.
[Recovery pins](docs/reports/nplayer-size-smoke-artifacts/smoke--recovery.json),
[export audit](docs/reports/nplayer-size-smoke-artifacts/smoke--export-audit.json)
and [exact operations](docs/reports/nplayer-size-smoke-artifacts/smoke--operations.json)
record the remaining paths and identities.

Dependencies: `repo` is a shared clone of PR289's host checkout, which itself
depends on PR288 and #283's shared Git objects. `.venv` and `tables` refer to
#283's qualified environment and pinned K50 inputs. Original Drive archive,
member, hashes and retrieval provenance are in
[#283's input receipt](docs/reports/cygnus-x1-artifacts/input-restoration.json).
Protect the entire dependency chain, active worktree and ignored local
`planning/nplayer-size-smoke/` helpers/receipt copies. No M4 use or cleanup.

## PR289 — N-player traversal and known games (merged with owner authorization, October 15, 2026)

[PR289](https://github.com/dberweger2017/CFR-NLHE-6max/pull/289), branch
`feature/nplayer-traversal-known-games`; [report](docs/reports/nplayer-traversal.md),
[protocol](docs/nplayer-traversal-protocol.md). Initial scientific source
`1578d66fe7e47bed1d72ee34651893d76d625824`; final core/confirmation source
`7900a8019ed6b868891c0b733adfa0da768f1a1e`, native tree
`e3f8ad4e4190fefbdde4f7cdeb68f81e848a0fa0`. Rebase after the owner's PR288 merge
produces `f4bc8d2b689060ce56f4fedd6fcb4b375aa19a78` with identical native bytes.

**Protected open-PR working evidence, not an accepted cloud archive:**
`bb128:/home/dberweger/nplayer-traversal-20261015/`. Retain the complete root,
including failed setup probes, first failed Leduc quality study, separately
owner-approved passing confirmation, analytical/uniform reference profiles,
original-endpoint byte reproduction, commands, logs, watchdog telemetry,
source bundles/stashes, binaries, small-game checkpoints/exports and cash/HU
regression payloads. Compact receipts live in
`docs/reports/nplayer-traversal-artifacts/`. No generated policy or checkpoint
is committed to Git. Cloud archival/upload acceptance and cleanup are pending;
no original has been removed.

Each initial/confirmation result names its relative average-profile path and
SHA256 plus its sibling checkpoint SHA256. Exact runtime arguments, binary
hashes and source pins are in the corresponding admission/command receipts.
For a needed payload, copy its receipt-named path into a fresh ignored local
folder, for example `rsync -a bb128:/home/dberweger/nplayer-traversal-20261015/leduc-confirmation-results/leduc-2026101511/ results/nplayer-confirmation-seed1/`,
then verify complete SHA256s against
[confirmation results](docs/reports/nplayer-traversal-artifacts/leduc-confirmation-results--results.json).
This is host retrieval, not accepted cloud restoration. This experiment's
small-game exports are evaluator inputs, not cash-game policies for play.

Dependencies: `repo` is a shared Git clone of PR288's host checkout and relies
on both that object store and #283's qualification object store. Its `.venv`
points to `/home/dberweger/cygnus-qualification-20261014/repo-main/.venv`;
`reference-packages` is a separate OpenSpiel 2.0.2 installation, leaving the
qualified environment unchanged. `tables` points to #283's qualification K50
inputs; original archive/member/hash/retrieval provenance is in
[#283's input receipt](docs/reports/cygnus-x1-artifacts/input-restoration.json).
Retain all these dependencies, the active checkout and its ignored local
`planning/nplayer-traversal/` helper/receipt copies through independent review.
No M4 data or process is used.

## PR288 — N-player rules parity (reviewed and owner-merged, October 15, 2026)

[PR288](https://github.com/dberweger2017/CFR-NLHE-6max/pull/288), branch
`feature/nplayer-game-parity`; [report](docs/reports/nplayer-game-parity.md).
Scientific source `35483892a3aba6e51cc1ba3f1c0963c7e3fb9c34`, native tree
`a863c89425bb5f36f231dad52018c24e7b744f18`. One million three-player hands,
5,981,964 decisions, zero pinned-engine mismatches; the ordered complete-trace
SHA256 is `67ae6a3f153e021ec579f5547e1fb9b2fba132633da3b455c6ad1293ec21c366`.
Traces stream without retaining bulky successful fixtures; the pinned source,
engine and seeds in the [result](docs/reports/nplayer-game-parity-artifacts/million--result.json)
reproduce the stream. No N-player training model has been produced.

**Protected open-PR working evidence, not an accepted cloud archive:**
`bb128:/home/dberweger/nplayer-phase1-20261015/`. This contains the failed initial
pilot, corrected pilot, million/supplemental parity runs, exact commands, logs,
watchdog telemetry and HU regression checkpoints/exports. Compact results are in
`docs/reports/nplayer-game-parity-artifacts/`. Generated payloads remain outside
Git. No Drive archive/upload acceptance or cleanup is claimed; archival closeout
is pending. Retain this root and its dependencies through independent review.

HU regression payload pins and commands are recorded in
[HU identities](docs/reports/nplayer-game-parity-artifacts/hu-identities--receipt.json),
[#250 fresh/resume](docs/reports/nplayer-game-parity-artifacts/gate-results--checkpoints.json)
and [HU20 identity](docs/reports/nplayer-game-parity-artifacts/hu20-release-identity--result.json).
For a needed payload, copy its receipt-named path from bb128 into a fresh ignored
`results/` directory with `rsync -a bb128:/home/dberweger/nplayer-phase1-20261015/<path> results/<new-path>`
and verify its complete SHA256 against the corresponding receipt before use.
This is host retrieval, not cloud restoration.

Read-only dependencies: `repo/.venv` points to
`/home/dberweger/cygnus-qualification-20261014/repo-main/.venv`; the new shared
Git clone also depends on that qualification checkout's object store.
`tables` points to `/home/dberweger/cygnus-qualification-20261014/tables`.
All three full K50 inputs were rehashed before use. Their exact Drive archive,
member paths, sizes, hashes and retrieval commands remain in
[#283's input restoration receipt](docs/reports/cygnus-x1-artifacts/input-restoration.json).
Do not remove these inputs, the shared Git store, or either active checkout.

## M4 headroom for HU100 seed qualification — October 15

Owner-requested cleanup reclaims **17.826 GB** from five unchanged archived

upload acceptance and dependency/modification-history checks. Verified M4
**64.977 GB /60.514 GiB free** at 2026-10-15T06:33:23Z.
Both final averages, all seed1 originals, shared inputs/tables, new HU100 root
and server preparations remain. Seed1 full retry is still unaccepted, so its
checkpoints/current export remain. Earlier PR278 local retention snapshots are
superseded only for these five exact paths.

## Another 30 GB on M4 — October 14

Owner-requested cleanup exceeds the target with **32.500 GB**
reclaimed: five unchanged archived HU100 originals and three explicitly approved
inactive rebuildable policy caches under merged PR272. Verified M4 free
**77.768 GB** at 2026-10-14T16:20:35Z; live PR278 trainer still observed.

precede original retirement; parent copies match accepted PR260 pins without
checkpoint retrieval or repeat payload hashes. Canonical tables, PR265 HU200
averages, released model/Slumbot inputs and active #278 roots remain. Original
retention snapshots are superseded only for these exact eight paths; cloud
files remain. Owner now permits inactive rebuildable caches/regenerable output
without repeated approval when there is no data loss or active-PR impact.

## M4 disk admission cleanup — October 14 evening

Owner-requested cleanup releases **15.132 GB** on M4: two
explicitly owner-approved uploaded PR272 ZIP caches and two merged inactive Rust
debug caches. Verified **49.562 GiB /53.217 GB free**

uploaded unused ZIP caches while its PR is open; its worktree/models/tables and
all scientific originals remain. Both cloud files/IDs/placeholders survive;
69 checked research/model/table files match before/after metadata. No synced
deletion, force offload, unpinning, payload download or repeated hashes.

It retains the closed model-archive guard, previous lifecycle guard,
all model/archive receipts, final report snapshot, failures and36comparisons of
archived raw trace hashes against existing play/reproduction completion pins,
without another raw-hash pass or outcome readout. Native and independent cloud
acceptance pass. Its final two guard observations are in
[terminal-final-lifecycle.json](docs/reports/hu100-v053-three-seeds-artifacts/terminal-final-lifecycle.json),

survive in raw archives or the tiny compact final lifecycle receipt.
[M4 released receipt](docs/reports/hu100-v053-three-seeds-artifacts/m4-released.json):
all owned science/archive workers exited and both locks verified free;
26.77GiB free at the release observation after owner-managed cleanup. Archival closeout is complete;
final reporting-branch CI and owner review remain. The campaign timer stays disabled.

After downloading an accepted named archive to a fresh ignored directory, this
command verifies whole, embedded manifest and extracted member hashes. Change
`seed` to2026101502 for the second average. Do not overwrite active inputs.

```sh
python - <<'PYRESTORE'
import json
from pathlib import Path
from scripts.run_hu100_k50_v2 import restore
seed = 2026101501
receipt = json.loads(Path(f'docs/reports/hu100-v053-three-seeds-artifacts/{seed}-average-archive-receipt.json').read_text())
receipt['path'] = f'results/pr286-downloads/hu100-v053-seed-{seed}-average.zip'
restore(receipt, f'averages/{seed}/5000000000.average.gz',
        Path(f'results/pr286-restored/{seed}/5000000000.average.gz'))
PYRESTORE
```

For a checkpoint instead of an average, select its exact filename from
`archive-catalog.json["models"][str(seed)]`, use that row’s `archive` and
`member`, and load the corresponding archive receipt; the same `restore`
function verifies the whole/manifest/member hashes before use.

For a raw evidence member use the partial archive receipt, its downloaded ZIP
path and the exact `research/...` member from its manifest. For closed resource
traces use the lifecycle receipt and
`research/guards/operations/partial-preservation/resources.jsonl`.
For a model checkpoint/current export, use the corresponding `<seed>-model-archive-receipt.json`, downloaded `hu100-v053-seed-<seed>-models.zip` and member `research/<seed>/<filename>` from the linked model index. Both seeds’ model archives are accepted; exact Drive IDs and eight archive/member/size/hash mappings are in the catalog above.
Closeout CI on5395cc9 failed the inherited N-player example allocation test

## PR272 — HU100 v2 frozen 5B (October 14, 2026)

[PR272](https://github.com/dberweger2017/CFR-NLHE-6max/pull/272),
[report](docs/reports/hu100-v2-frozen-5b.md),
[predeclared protocol](docs/hu100-v2-frozen-5b-protocol.md).
**Final science and all three archives accepted; owner decides merge.**
Scientific source `fd066d26e61cab1ecc2d7f9e131ce2beac296998`; canonical plan SHA256 `ff344a114e8d30fd16643b9b801de880828d00d0cf26bb211f6a97665fb53f75`. All **1,179,648 final original hands** replay and exactly reproduce before readout, at full requested counts: 16,384 blocks per each of seven opponents in both panels and 131,072 descriptive direct blocks. The predeclared v0.5.3 candidate rule **passes**; no release/default change. The absent #260 terminal was regenerated byte-identically, then frozen at all **97,290,578 entries** to **5,000,006,023 nodes**. Every current/average row audits. Stored visits/key **5.2673**, zero visits **32.70%**, discarded updates **1,092,540,595**; river training misses **64.10% traverser /56.66% opponent** over the full frozen continuation. These differ from played-hand coverage. [Exact models, restoration members and dependencies](docs/reports/hu100-v2-frozen-5b-artifacts/model-index.json).

Each ZIP embeds `ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json`; all member sizes/hashes passed complete local readback and whole hashing. Separate [native uploaded/no-pending/no-conflicts](docs/reports/hu100-v2-frozen-5b-artifacts/native-upload-acceptance.json) and [independent Drive ID/name/size/direct-parent confirmation](docs/reports/hu100-v2-frozen-5b-artifacts/cloud-upload-acceptance.json) accept all three. **Remote archive bytes were not downloaded or verified.**

Full evidence includes `research/training/5000000000{,.current,.average}.gz`, all final/pilot hand and decision traces under `research/{primary-OPPONENT,learning-OPPONENT,direct,pilot-*}/{play,reproduction}/`, independent replay receipts, canonical plan/readback, every-row audit, parent regeneration telemetry, build/source snapshots and closed scientific guards. The separate average ZIP contains `averages/5000000000.average.gz`. The closeout ZIP retains every reading from the closed archive guard plus archive receipts and the all-operation resource summary. No reading is dropped. The pre-hand admission failure and original logs remain in the full ZIP; no scientific retry, hand replacement, reduction or extension.

Restore: download the selected linked ZIP into a fresh ignored unsynced directory, verify its whole SHA256 above, then `python -m zipfile -e ARCHIVE.zip NEW_RESTORE_ROOT`. Verify `ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json` and selected member size/SHA256 against this index before use.

Root `~/Local/hu200-v2-frozen-5b-20261014/results/hu200-v2-frozen-5b`. Fresh/resumed20M bytes match; frozen5B reaches **5,000,000,090 nodes /95,707,874 entries**, and every current/average row audits. Full requested 16,384 panel blocks per seven opponents and 131,072 descriptive direct blocks; all **720,896 final primary hands** independently replay/reproduce before readout. Pressure contrast **+238.59 [201.61,275.57]**, half-pot **−32.31 [−59.14,−5.48] BB/100**; three safeguards fail. **No Slumbot preparation, live play, release or default change.** Owner decides merge.

unpinning, archive download or repeated payload hashing.

## PR268 — HU200 K50 frozen-table playing comparison (October 14, 2026)

[PR268](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/268), [report](docs/reports/hu200-frozen-evaluation.md), [protocol](docs/hu200-frozen-evaluation-protocol.md). **Final scientific result and accepted evidence.** M4 source `cc98b63858ed508ccff3491fc86c9e5f8bca87f6`, run `~/Local/hu200-frozen-evaluation-20261014/results/hu200-frozen-evaluation`. Fixed 262,144 primary /131,072 learning-curve blocks and 16,384 per seven scripts; no reduction. All **1,245,184 final hands** independently replay and exactly reproduce before readout. Final 20B minus 752M is **+76.95 [71.93,81.96] BB/100**; paired final-minus-5B performance against 752M **+0.09 [−8.36,8.54]** is inconclusive, not a direct duel. The fixed rule passes and recommends external confirmation. No new Slumbot hands, account creation, credentials, merge, release or default change.

Scientific members include `research/{canonical-plan.json,plan-posted.json,inputs.json,summary.json,coverage.csv}`, each contrast's `research/{primary,curve,panel-OPPONENT}/{play,reproduction}/{hands,decisions}.jsonl.gz`, independent replay receipts, cost pilots, source/protocol snapshots and the complete 916-reading scientific guard. The supplement's `closeout/closed-archive-guard/` has the two closed archive readings/log/receipt; `closeout/resources.jsonl` retains all 136 offline server preparation readings. It includes cache/client/copy receipts, launcher/helper source, cloud/native receipts and all administrative failures, including the original metadata helper import error. No failed hand or scientific attempt was rerun. Actual archive member hashes and original paths/mtime are in each embedded manifest.

Restoration into a **fresh ignored unsynced** directory: download the pinned evidence or model ZIP, verify its whole SHA256, then `python -m zipfile -e ARCHIVE.zip NEW_RESTORE_ROOT`; verify `ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json` against the listed manifest SHA256 and every selected member's size/SHA256. For one model use `python -c 'import sys,zipfile; zipfile.ZipFile(sys.argv[1]).extract(sys.argv[2],sys.argv[3])' MODEL_ARCHIVE.zip EXACT_MEMBER NEW_RESTORE_ROOT`, followed by `shasum -a 256 NEW_RESTORE_ROOT/EXACT_MEMBER` against its pin. Verify the table TAR whole hash then extract its named members to a fresh path and verify all three member hashes. Scientific source restores by `git checkout cc98b63858ed508ccff3491fc86c9e5f8bca87f6`; restoration does not authorize another campaign or overwrite active inputs.

All members of each local ZIP passed complete size/SHA256 readback, followed by whole hashing. [Local receipts](docs/reports/hu200-k50-frozen-artifacts/archive-receipt.json), [average receipt](docs/reports/hu200-k50-frozen-artifacts/averages-receipt.json), [closeout receipt](docs/reports/hu200-k50-frozen-artifacts/closeout-receipt.json). Primary ZIP snapshots the closed scientific prefix; the closeout ZIP supplies every closed stage2/retention resource reading, completion/sealing receipts and the original failed optional plotting attempt. Scientific bytes passed on their first attempt. At campaign closeout models, tables and partial evidence remained; only earlier checkpoints had been removed after verified successors. The separate [October 14 storage pass](docs/artifacts/storage-vacuum-20261014.md) subsequently retired 11 exact archived originals and released accepted archive caches, preserving both averages and tables.

[Native observation](docs/reports/hu200-k50-frozen-artifacts/native-upload-observation.json) records uploaded1/uploading0/conflicts0 for the averages and closeout ZIPs. [Independent metadata](docs/reports/hu200-k50-frozen-artifacts/cloud-upload-observation.json) confirms their exact IDs/names/sizes/direct parent. The original full-upload observation was pending. [Current cleanup acceptance](docs/artifacts/storage-vacuum-20261014.md) confirms the full ZIP uploaded with independent ID/name/size/parent acceptance. Null historical file IDs were unknown. **Remote archive bytes were not downloaded or verified.**

The average-only ZIP uses `averages/5000000000.average.gz` and `averages/20000000000.average.gz` with identical model sizes/hashes. Tables are not duplicated: use the [accepted PR163 table record](#pr163-full-deck-equity-buckets--october-5-closeout) and [this campaign's full input pins](docs/reports/hu200-k50-frozen-artifacts/inputs.json). The target-named stage1 `1000000000.gz` contains 752,593,175 actual nodes; it did not reach 1B.

Retrieval: download the linked averages ZIP to a fresh ignored `results/` directory, or read the local synced archive on M4. Verify the whole ZIP before extracting, then verify every selected model's size/SHA256. This command reads the local archive, creates a unique ignored restore root and never launches science:

## PR265 M4 inactive-evidence cleanup — October 13, 2026

Owner-authorized cleanup for [PR265](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/265) removed **38 unchanged files /28,373,295,553 bytes** from merged, inactive PR207/254/260 unsynced results roots. Current native accepted upload and independent Drive ID/name/size/direct-parent acceptance preceded deletion; recorded original paths/sizes/mtime and live dependencies were checked. Two uncertain PR207 files were retained. [Receipt and all restoration links/commands](docs/artifacts/pr265-m4-storage-20261013.md), [per-file archive/member/hash receipt](docs/reports/hu200-k50-frozen-artifacts/m4-cleanup-receipt.json), [dependency review](docs/reports/hu200-k50-frozen-artifacts/m4-cleanup-dependency-review.json). PR207 retry ZIP ID `1iowJoQBQqB3tLRnU6GD0JcniF0qDIvgj` now has current confirmed acceptance, superseding its earlier upload-pending snapshot. No repeated archive/member hash audit, synced deletion, eviction or forced offload. Source/environments/tables/shared Git and active inputs remain. After removal the filesystem reported 101,546,766,336 free bytes; removed-file bytes are the accountable cleanup total, not the entire observed free-space change. Historical originals-retained statements are superseded only for the receipt paths.

## Uploaded cache pass — October 13 evening

Owner-requested storage pass releases **32.176 GB** from
nine confirmed uploaded archive caches and one inactive #258 Rust debug cache.
Verified free **M1 59.940 GB /M4 73.163 GB**.

SHA256 `8a431cf112236d90f8ff707d8f2d1f75b9d265f04c9376ff1e30b1f9af86e8d5`; current confirmed Research-Cloud upload).
Active #265 and its lineage/engineering/evaluation/table dependencies remain.
Its authorized original cleanup is separate; this pass removes no research
originals and credits no other agent's reclamation. Same-ID/same-size cloud
copies and placeholders remain; no synced deletion, force offload, unpinning,
archive download, repeated payload hashing or research/schedule change.

Post-pack successful archive-guard/upload/CI receipts remain Git lifecycle records rather than an archive rewrite.

Failures retained: the initial descriptive server pass lacked guards, then the **same anchored prefix** was reverified under guards with an identical result; original source patch and both analyses remain. Local full-suite clean-source checks initially saw report edits, then passed on a clean checkout. Two archive-only setup failures (missing import path, then shell-quoting syntax error) wrote **no ZIP**, played **no hands**, had no resource breach and are embedded under `research/archive-guarded{,-02}/` with original helper copies. Successful archive guard is [separate](docs/reports/hu200-missing-key-fallback-artifacts/archive-guards.json). No scientific failed hand, sample extension, rerun, training, deletion, synced-folder eviction or force offload. Server/M1 originals, own worktrees and all shared inputs remain.

Every member of all four locally sealed ZIPs was read back against exact size/SHA256 pins, followed by whole-archive hashing. The 542-member main ZIP retains training/gates, native binary, source snapshot, plans, all original/reproduced traces, independent replays and five-second resource streams. The separate average ZIP contains only `averages/332894788.average.gz` plus its manifest. The 9-member closeout ZIP preserves the otherwise excluded, closed archive guard readings and post-seal receipts. [Sealing receipts](docs/reports/hu100-k50-v2-artifacts/model-index.json), [closeout receipt](docs/reports/hu100-k50-v2-artifacts/closeout-archive-receipt.json).

Closeout ZIP cloud ID/name/size/direct parent were independently confirmed: [hu100-k50-v2-archive-closeout.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ewQbad_ctJNHeIC27N1Q1MfrPjfaU-Rg/view?usp=drivesdk), ID `1ewQbad_ctJNHeIC27N1Q1MfrPjfaU-Rg`. All four archives now have current native uploaded1/uploading0/unresolved-conflicts0/excluded0/paused0/trashed0 status with matching byte counts. Earlier pending-upload snapshots retained missing conflict fields as null, never presumed zero; these are historical evidence, superseded by current acceptance. [Current native status](docs/reports/hu100-k50-v2-artifacts/native-upload-current.json) and [cloud metadata snapshot](docs/reports/hu100-k50-v2-artifacts/cloud-upload-acceptance.json) distinguish native pending, cloud locators and local integrity. **New remote archive bytes were not downloaded or re-audited.**

The unchanged #163 table members and published v0.5.2 model use the exact accepted records/retrieval commands in [PR254's input index](#pr254--hu100-k50-2b-versus-released-v052-october-13), [input receipt](docs/reports/hu100-k50-vs-v052-artifacts/inputs.json). All original/copied table and model hashes were verified before use. Released average: 2,121,415,396 bytes, SHA256 `0ed7f9512996bb3e9535a7258a5d0e4bc8c00f22734d511c642c0e5b95cbd3c0`, verified by its own publication verifier at source `3a3bc4218bab96637d6a27a69b73383ee8bb196c`.

Verify each ZIP against the whole hash above **before extraction**, then verify `ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json` and each required member against the indexed manifest pins. Source restoration: clone the repository into a fresh checkout and `git checkout d7e03e36bdaed5f3d8972d4320cc04ce73289325`; scientific worker is `python -m scripts.run_hu100_k50_v2`, with all final roots and immutable counts in the archived canonical plan. Replay on restored copies, not the active output paths.

No remote archive bytes were downloaded.

There was no scientific failure, guard stop, failed-hand rerun or outcome extension. Administrative upload-field parsing and helper import-path errors were corrected and retained in compact receipts without rerunning science. SSH interruptions changed no campaign processes. All originals and active inputs remain. **M4 released on PR260 at 17:54 Madrid**, after verified worker exit, free research lock and full local readback; background uploads may continue.

Final engineering smoke only: 128 real-model direct duplicate blocks and 32 paired blocks per script, all hands/decisions replayed and reproduced; no campaign or reported playing outcomes. M1 only, 62.64s /0.963GiB sampled peak, normal pressure. HU100 64 hands /289 decisions match main's exact decompressed hand/decision/public-event bytes. All originals remain in the open PR root `~/Local/hu200-evaluation-harness-20261013/results/hu200-harness/`.

Whole ZIP, manifest, all member sizes/SHA256 and native copy readback pass. Native uploaded1/uploading0/conflicts0 and independent connector ID/name/size/parent plus direct-folder membership accept it. [Acceptance](docs/reports/hu200-evaluation-harness-artifacts/archive-acceptance.json). Remote archive bytes were not downloaded or reverified.

All local member/whole/native-copy checks and native uploaded1/uploading0/conflicts0 plus connector ID/name/size/parent acceptance pass; no remote-byte download. [Receipt](docs/reports/hu200-evaluation-harness-artifacts/closeout-acceptance.json). Restore by this pinned ID with its whole/manifest/member hashes as for the primary ZIP; it performs no further evaluation and changes no primary bundle. Final self-indexing metadata and CI status remain in Git/PR.

Members `evidence/real-direct/{play,reproduction}/`, `evidence/real-panel/{opponent}/{play,reproduction}/`, fixture outputs/models/cache, `evidence/resources.json`, smoke worker/supervisor and input stats/pins preserve all runs and receipts. `source/` contains the implementation files and pre-closeout report/roadmap snapshot. The early import-path setup failure made no evaluations; `evidence/setup-import-failure-{smoke.log,resources.json}` retains it. No scientific retry or outcome selection. The report/index and accepted-upload receipt are later Git metadata; the primary bundle is immutable.

Canonical #250 K50 input was used **read only**, not copied: `~/Local/slumbot-k50-20261013/model/research/training/1000000000.average.gz`, 2,221,370,011 bytes /SHA256 `60bd37c979e018f11f136370f468cc41b8e1435550531707e89d45f28709ec7c`, 752,593,175 actual nodes /85,373,907 entries. The `tables/` and verified `cache/` in that owner-provided root retain their original sizes/mtime; provenance/pins are `evidence/real-input.json`, confirmed by `evidence/read-only-verification.json`. Model archive/member/manifest hashes and restoration commands are the [PR250 record](#pr250-first-hu200-k50-model--october-13-2026); its separately indexed PR163 tables restore with the three pinned SHA256s. New local fixture caches are inside this PR root; existing model/cache roots, other worktrees and all running processes are untouched.

Restoration: download archive ID `15xKqTRwRUVmdz3jxp-a5XRlOic67IKIE` to a **new ignored nonsynced path**, check `shasum -a 256 ARCHIVE.zip` against the whole hash above, then extract with `python -m zipfile -e ARCHIVE.zip NEW_RESTORE_ROOT`. Check `ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json` SHA256 above and each required member's recorded byte count/SHA256 before use. Tiny fixtures are `evidence/hu200-{left,right}/average.gz`; HU100 fixtures are `evidence/hu100-fixtures/{training,average}.gz`, with exact sizes/hashes in the manifest. Real averages/tables restore through PR250/PR163 rather than this evidence ZIP. Restoring evidence does not authorize a campaign. No local deletion, cache eviction or synced-folder cleanup.

For retrieval, download by the exact evidence Drive ID `1cOtEtzdpo7EP25ocJJAzOYpDJE5avmpS` into a **fresh ignored nonsynced** directory as `ARCHIVE.zip`; require `shasum -a 256 ARCHIVE.zip` to equal the whole SHA256 above. Then `python3 -m zipfile -e ARCHIVE.zip results/retrieved/pr262/NEW_ROOT`; verify `ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json` hash, and each needed member's byte count/SHA256 against it. Models additionally require the exact hashes in the table above. Source snapshot, `research/main-source.tar`, main/candidate executables, build receipts, successful test/gate logs, initial development test failures, raw telemetry and 200-ms resource samples are preserved in the primary ZIP. This readback proves local contents; upload acceptance proves native/cloud metadata, not independently downloaded bytes.

Current Git receipts are authoritative for the final self-indexing text and CI status. Native initial disconnected-upload readings and subsequent acceptance are retained. No scientific failures, budget resets or reruns; all original files and other PR dependencies remain.

## PR258 overbet-menu correctness evidence — October 13, 2026

[PR258](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/258), [report](docs/reports/overbet-correctness.md), [79-call/launcher inventory](docs/reports/overbet-correctness-artifacts/inventory.md), [complete identity/model-member receipts](docs/reports/overbet-correctness-artifacts/identity.json).

Native tree `a56ce73696e81a89e4a0fd2c66b8626f7ff91f35`. Final local verification record; cloud upload acceptance pending.

Own ignored work root `~/Local/overbet-correctness/planning/v2-correctness/`; separate pristine baseline checkout `~/Local/overbet-main-identity/`. Local Research-Cloud destination `~/Local/Research-Cloud/PR-258-overbet-correctness/`.

All 91 primary, 27 fixed-gzip and 5 CI-closeout files were read back from their newly created ZIPs against exact size/SHA256 manifests. [Primary receipt](docs/reports/overbet-correctness-artifacts/archive-receipt.json), [fixed-gzip receipt](docs/reports/overbet-correctness-artifacts/fixed-gzip-archive-receipt.json), [CI closeout receipt](docs/reports/overbet-correctness-artifacts/ci-archive-receipt.json). Primary contains main/branch native build receipts and binaries, native HU20/HU100 v1/v2 10k-node checkpoints/current/average files and HU100/v2 20k-node resume, normal-clock direct/pressure traces, all earlier test failures/logs, exact recipes and `research/code-source.tar`. The fixed-gzip supplement contains pristine-main/branch replayed hands/decisions at gzip mtime 1234567890 and `research/reproduce_fixed_gzip.py`; all four complete compressed streams match. The CI supplement preserves both initial failure logs, final source patch and all 33 affected local passing regressions. No failed evidence was replaced.

Required generated models/inputs: every main/branch native member path, byte count and SHA256 is under `native.archive_members` in the linked identity JSON (members `research/main-native/FILE` and `research/final-native/FILE`). The hand fixture is exactly reconstructible from the archived test source and recipes. No external model/table retrieval was needed. To retrieve the primary from the mounted, retained archive into a fresh ignored path:

```sh
python3 -m zipfile -e ~/Local/Research-Cloud/PR-258-overbet-correctness/overbet-correctness-M1-20261013.zip planning/retrieved/pr258-primary
python3 -m zipfile -e ~/Local/Research-Cloud/PR-258-overbet-correctness/fixed-gzip-identity-M1-20261013.zip planning/retrieved/pr258-fixed-gzip
python3 -m zipfile -e ~/Local/Research-Cloud/PR-258-overbet-correctness/ci-regression-closeout-M1-20261013.zip planning/retrieved/pr258-ci
```

Before extracting, verify the ZIP SHA256 above; after extraction, verify the named member's bytes/SHA256 from `ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json` (also recorded in the identity JSON for native models). Run the archived recipes with `PYTHONPATH=.` from the indexed source revisions. Folder/ZIP cloud locator acceptance can be recorded later; this record neither authorizes cleanup of open-PR evidence nor schedules it.


## Post-merge M1/M4 storage pass — October 13, 2026

Owner-requested cleanup retires **88.890 GB** of existing research copies:
13 uploaded native cache releases and **36 unchanged own #246/#252 evidence paths**.
Separately authorized uploaded personal backup cache releases **19.529 GB** on M1;
public records omit personal filenames. Verified free **M1 65.986 GB /M4 104.323 GB**.

or repeated payload audits. Live Slumbot #248 model/root, source/shared Git,
tables, installed release caches and uncertain/changed/unarchived files remain.
Incomplete #246 prefix remains unchanged online; no original removal relies on
it. No synced deletion, forced offload, unpinning or research/schedule change.
Earlier retained-original snapshots are superseded only for the 36 locator rows.

## PR249 Slumbot client live protocol checks — October 13, 2026

[PR249](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/249) played 32 anonymous live hands against Slumbot's public API to check the client: 12 probe-bot hands and 20 check/call hands through `scripts.play_slumbot`. No model and no strength claim. [Report](docs/reports/slumbot-client.md).

## PR254 — HU100 K50 2B versus released v0.5.2 (October 13)

[PR254](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/254), M4-only evidence. Scientific source `23af700ba79b62693cef1f5cf09d8693a1ec064e`; fresh roots `20261013101101/02/03`; canonical SHA256 `78e71e60720132edebff831abe3d78938411d06c9742ca755eb431549f35ff2a`, [posted/read back before final hands](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/254#issuecomment-6140708969). Fixed 262,144 direct blocks and 4,096 shared scripted blocks/opponent across K50 off, v0.5.2 on512/128 and off. All **770,048 final harness hands** independently replayed and exactly reproduced before readout. [Report](docs/reports/hu100-k50-2b-vs-v052.md), [compact evidence](docs/reports/hu100-k50-vs-v052-artifacts/summary.json).

Direct +23.31 [20.12,26.50] BB/100 meets the direct-only candidate rule. K50 without translation fails the scripted pot-pressure safeguard versus released translation-on v0.5.2 (−85.00 [−121.88,−48.12]); off-control −9.25 [−41.01,22.51] is inconclusive. The owner decides; no release/default/tag/new training. No scientific failure, failed-hand rerun or extension. A false trailing-newline posting check was resolved by exact complete-body verification before final hands, preserving original plan/source/counts; its failure/readback/receipt remain retained.

Current native **uploaded /not uploading /not paused /stable size+mtime /no upload error /zero conflicts**, plus independent cloud **ID/name/size/parent** confirmation, accept both ZIPs. [Native receipt](docs/reports/hu200-200m-model-artifacts/native-upload-acceptance.json), [cloud receipt](docs/reports/hu200-200m-model-artifacts/cloud-confirmation.json), [local readback receipt](docs/reports/hu200-200m-model-artifacts/archive-receipt.json). **No remote archive bytes were downloaded or verified.** Local integrity and remote upload acceptance remain distinct claims; upload delay did not trigger further science.

The [model index](docs/reports/hu200-200m-model-artifacts/model-index.json) gives every required model/recovery/runtime/source member path, bytes, SHA256, archive Drive URL/ID and safe retrieval command. The small ZIP's only member is `HU200-200000000.gz.average.gz`, **800,092,100 bytes**, SHA256 **b7c15eb642f2edec82df04983b28a8f80b8c3db310f3d6ea53e21aab6d120402**.

All own originals remain, including the active average. No source deletion, synced deletion/eviction, other-PR cleanup, M4 access, binary Git addition or unattended work. The full manifest records original paths, sizes, SHA256s and mtime identities for later authorized cleanup. Local source/provenance and accepted restoration archives remain dependencies; no automatic retraining or live run follows retrieval.

Complete local member size/SHA256 readback and whole hashes pass. Current native uploaded1/uploading0/conflicts0 and independent Drive ID/name/size/direct-parent-folder membership both accept each archive. [Native snapshots](docs/reports/hu200-k50-first-artifacts/native-status-003.json), [cloud listing](docs/reports/hu200-k50-first-artifacts/cloud-acceptance.json). **Remote archive bytes were not downloaded or reverified.** Earlier pending snapshots are retained; final acceptance supersedes them.

Manual restoration: download the selected pinned ID as `ARCHIVE.zip` into fresh ignored nonsynced storage, `shasum -a 256 ARCHIVE.zip` against the whole hash above, verify `ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json`, then `python -c 'import sys,zipfile; zipfile.ZipFile(sys.argv[1]).extract(sys.argv[2],sys.argv[3])' ARCHIVE.zip research/training/1000000000.average.gz RESTORE_ROOT`; require the member size/SHA256 above. The model index binds 500M/terminal checkpoint/current/average locators and retrieval commands. Native executable is `research/bin/hu20-trainer`; source is recovered by Git at the indexed revision. PR163 tables restore from indexed archive `1Gl1JYWN0F7KFJbwoKtcA0zB_rUsWWZ6T`, member prefix `hu20-equity-buckets-20261005/`, whole SHA256 `03d4828f030082f213c8ce82e29fa0fa8fd97288bd8035ad0056de85bc0816ca`, with all three full table hashes in the input/model index. Original retrieval receipt's folder-valued archive_id is explicitly corrected there.

All setup observations, byte-identical gate runs, source/build/binary, telemetry and guard readings are preserved. No scientific failure/retry/guard breach. At this record all originals remain; any later cleanup requires current merged-owner/upload/dependency/stat acceptance and its own receipt. PR246 root/uploads are untouched.

K50 at 2B versus v1 at 2B is **+31.14 [+27.79, +34.50] BB/100**, a nominal paired 95% interval. Recommend K50 for HU200; the owner decides.

Final source `36dbe21ed36b2c3196f93c4b170446e97009d88b`; verified final research-only record. Native/cloud upload acceptance is separate from local member readback.

Checkpoints/current/average exports restore from the full archive’s `research/training/` members; exact sizes/SHA256s and executable commands are in the linked model index. Verify whole archive SHA256, extract only the named member into a fresh ignored nonsynced directory, and verify member SHA256 before use. Small ZIP averages are `averages/1000000000.average.gz` and `averages/2000000000.average.gz`. Controls remain pinned release downloads; tables remain the indexed #163 archive. Source/build/recovery, guards, traces, audits, setup/credential failures and retrieval provenance are preserved. No cleanup or other-PR dependency changes. Original incomplete ZIP prefix remains retained separately, with no accepted-model claim. This accepted record supersedes the earlier pending-storage handoff below; its model paths remain protected.

## PR246 — HU100 K50 1B/2B guarded partial (October 12)

Historical stop record, superseded by the accepted owner-authorized final continuation above. The original failures and prefix remain preserved.

Both K50 training targets and every-row export audits completed. **No final strength comparison ran.** The cost-only pilot stopped on warning memory pressure; preservation then stopped on fixed-baseline swap growth. The HU100 abstraction question remains unanswered.

[Report](docs/reports/hu100-k50-2b.md), [model index](docs/reports/hu100-k50-2b-artifacts/model-index.json), [pending storage](docs/reports/hu100-k50-2b-artifacts/pending-storage.json). Training source `be2692c311eaedc8670d9e12e6e424f73d2d3b60`; pilot source `1db150f106f4bb80aefec824456fd0d72316bd81`. M4 released; no further research/packaging worker scheduled.

Native and independent cloud metadata confirm only this prefix. No completed member manifest/whole SHA256/member readback: **not an accepted or usable model archive**. Separate averages ZIP not created.
- Six completed originals remain protected on M4 in `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu100-k50-2b-20261012/results/hu100-k50-2b/training/`. Model index records each exact path, kind, byte count, audited full SHA256, actual nodes/iterations/entries, modification metadata and conditional owner-authorized direct-copy/hash commands. No accepted archive member/retrieval locator exists yet. Retain all originals, inputs, guards and partials; no cleanup is permitted.
- Controls remain pinned v0.5.0/v0.5.1 release downloads with their own `--require-publication` verifiers and exact expected sources. #163 tables remain in the existing indexed archive `1Gl1JYWN0F7KFJbwoKtcA0zB_rUsWWZ6T`, whole SHA256 `03d4828f030082f213c8ce82e29fa0fa8fd97288bd8035ad0056de85bc0816ca`; exact table members/pins/restoration commands remain in #235’s external-dependency record and `docs/reports/k50-evaluation-support-artifacts/restoration.json`.

No remote archive bytes downloaded or re-audited. Complete native audits are separate from incomplete archival. Pilot warning-pressure and archive swap-growth failures are preserved; no final sample freeze, no final hands, no strength classification, no release/adoption/default or HU200 training. Archival awaits an owner-coordinated admissible window; no unattended work.

## PR242 HU20 K50 5B-to-10B continuation — verified, accepted evidence, October 12

[PR242](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/242), [report](docs/reports/hu20-k50-10b.md), branch `feature/hu20-k50-10b`, task-owned non-synced M4 root `~/Local/hu20-k50-10b-20261012/results/hu20-k50-10b/`. Native base `045c793a4abd2e371d4d77de663fd3dd2f00316b`, exact tree `06f98b959e7b56068918bb0cc7b9c162511c7686`; unchanged source. Three exact 5B lineages reach 10B concurrently in 52.64 minutes; every current/average row audits. All 49,152 descriptive hands independently replay. **10B versus own 5B +0.22 [−3.98, +4.42] BB/100**, nominal paired 95% conditional on fixed policies: further improvement is inconclusive, not a plateau or release decision. No extension, failed-hand rerun, release confirmation, adoption or model selection. Scientific Python source is pinned to main `600bd34cca328cd19b65f5fb14141fdcb397e966`; task control sources are member-hashed in the full ZIP. Merge and cleanup follow reviewed final-head checks.

The owner explicitly authorized the exact archived executable after the new-root build mismatch caused the required stop. [Restoration receipt](docs/reports/hu20-k50-10b-artifacts/restoration.json) records the accepted #238 [ZIP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FdnBZP2pRu-JB0JtHgtTuijNlXhxNmh-/view), **4,697,444,347 bytes**, SHA256 `2b7e5f8bf41ebdd8f8a9f8dcd5ed0d1d174e865ab62c49962bea4089a6241f27`, embedded `ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json` SHA256 `528f23792f27488882a37f76ff6f2ac453af2dcf69fafead3ae6b41b406b3fc0`. Its executable member `research/bin/hu20-trainer`, **1,349,488 bytes**, SHA256 `aa7d3a5ef197f113c82a3e861abdc3081af9f5262f96f991e093d6d5a7a0add6`, restores to the own ignored `inputs/bin/hu20-trainer` after whole/archive/member verification and chmod. Failed-build evidence remains preserved.

Required 5B checkpoints and averages restore from the same accepted ZIP, using only the six named K50 members in [#238's exact model index](docs/reports/hu20-k50-5b-first-pass-artifacts/model-index.json). All bytes and SHA256s reverify; hashes/schema/iterations/key counts and original telemetry agree. [Table receipt](docs/reports/hu20-k50-10b-artifacts/tables-restoration.json) records the whole-hash-verified #163 archive and every table member; see its existing indexed Drive ID `1Gl1JYWN0F7KFJbwoKtcA0zB_rUsWWZ6T`. No payload is copied from another open PR root or committed to Git.

Manual executable retrieval into a fresh ignored directory, after verifying the whole ZIP hash:

```sh
unzip -p ARCHIVE.zip ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json > NEW_IGNORED_DIR/ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json
shasum -a 256 NEW_IGNORED_DIR/ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json
unzip -p ARCHIVE.zip research/bin/hu20-trainer > NEW_IGNORED_DIR/hu20-trainer
shasum -a 256 NEW_IGNORED_DIR/hu20-trainer
# Verify 1,349,488 bytes and the exact manifest/member hashes above before chmod/use.
chmod 755 NEW_IGNORED_DIR/hu20-trainer
```

The [20M fresh/resumed byte identity and three native 5B load checks](docs/reports/hu20-k50-10b-artifacts/gates-complete.json) pass; no load-only iterations/saves occurred. [Fixed budget](docs/reports/hu20-k50-10b-artifacts/budget.json) ends 21:17:03 Madrid /19:17:03 UTC. [Root reservation](docs/reports/hu20-k50-10b-artifacts/root-reservation.json) reserves 20261012081101 before outcomes for exactly 8,192 descriptive duplicate blocks per seed, seats rotated. M4 compute was explicitly released **19:20 Madrid /17:20 UTC**, October 12. The original total-finish estimate was **19:50 Madrid /17:50 UTC**; #242 merged at 19:41:06 Madrid /17:41:06 UTC and its own-original cleanup is complete, as recorded below. Final housekeeping PR checks and merge close the task. No scientific work remains. The verified 10B model index and accepted full/three-average-only archives follow.

Restore pinned #163 tables through the indexed dependency receipt; never overwrite an active input. Post-merge cleanup trusts current confirmed uploads and existing manifests/provenance without downloading archives or repeating member audits; exact own path/size/mtime and dependencies remain mandatory. No synced deletion/offload.

**Post-merge cleanup completed:** #242 merge `64e076cf7d431c8f3ab75b4202dc8e89dfc911dd`, October12 17:41:06UTC. **29 unchanged own files /8,217,050,986bytes** removed, **8.288GB measured gain /100.550GB free**.

The sole denied owned handle query is a verified Apple ContextStoreAgent, narrowly excluded by exact executable/command/cwd/PID/creation identity; no research dependencies or uncertain owned metadata remained. Fresh native/input/cloud acceptance and dependency/path/size/mtime checks preceded removal. Existing confirmed archives/manifests are trusted without remote downloads or repeated payload/member audits. Synced files, other agents’ dependencies, source/environment, shared Git, guards/budget/failure history, compact or changed/unarchived files remain protected.

## Extended M1/M4 cleanup — October 12, 2026

Owner requested maximum eligible reclamation without a fixed target. **109.818 GB of existing allocated copies retired**: 192 unchanged accepted research paths, 819 supported uploaded/unpinned cache releases and one idle committed worktree. Verified **M1 95.980 GB /M4 102.388 GB free**. Active #242/#243, #238 inputs/binary/archive, #163 tables, current release caches, canonical #207 originals, current source/build/Git, uncertain/changed/unarchived files and personal data remain protected.

[Receipt/safeguards and worktree restoration](docs/artifacts/storage-vacuum-20261012-max.md), [all 192 removed paths and exact archive/member/hash locators](docs/artifacts/storage-vacuum-20261012-max-locators.md), [full private receipt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iDEI_hToPPf-D9xOXvX_PbijpmWD20F4/view?usp=drivesdk) (5,735,125 bytes, SHA256 `5a884ece439f6da732debfc6cbaa5c72754b61e927746c6be63710844f46b956`; confirmed Research-Cloud upload). Current merged/upload/dependency/path/size/modification-history checks and all hard links were reviewed; existing manifests/provenance were used without remote downloads or repeated payload audits. Earlier originals-retained statements are superseded only for the listed paths. No synced deletion, force offload, unpinning, app shutdown, scientific retry or schedule change.

Existing #236 folder `1OUNJcDqZLFRXsffKrtjDfliumj_DmdaI`, Research-Cloud parent 188bEt6i0RHqegCCdvpf3wPzUiRw78N2s. Copied as the already sealed ZIP without repacking; current native/cloud acceptance precedes original removal and cache release. The newly created backup cache is excluded from the existing-copy total to avoid double counting. The original calibration container restores as a whole archive through the exact locator row.

**Failure retained online:** incomplete #207 original ZIP is still unaccepted as scientific backup, but its own complete 3,354,661,317-byte uploaded failure file and same-ID/same-size placeholder remain after native cache release. No original removal relies on that incomplete ZIP; canonical #207 originals and accepted retry are retained. This supersedes only earlier local-cache-retained snapshots.

## M4 uploaded archive cache release for open K50 PR238 — October 12, 2026

Owner-requested cleanup released **19.778 GB** of native cache from merged #236's uploaded main ZIP. **M4 43.364 GB /40.386 GiB free**, above #238's original 38 GiB entry target; **M1 80.039 GB free**, no cleanup needed. Same Drive ID/name/logical size/parent and dataless local placeholder remain, with 6,787,072 allocated bytes. No research originals were removed; active #238 inputs and all #236 originals remain. No synced deletion, force offload, unpinning, app shutdown or research/schedule change.

[Receipt, exact cache path and restoration](docs/artifacts/storage-vacuum-20261012.md), [full private cleanup receipt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19s6rartMoLUjyiCQZv3Iq8ydh2ynWjEP/view) (481,394 bytes, SHA256 `922ad752d9874785e98035550de499f139cb6fdeaa6f5bc7404394ac253b0b8d`; confirmed Research-Cloud upload). Current #236 merged status, native upload/conflict/pin/download state, open handles, exact stat identity and independent cloud readback were checked. Existing manifest saved without remote downloads or repeated archive/member payload audits. The accepted #236 scientific archive below remains preserved online, and its historical originals-retained statement still holds.

The other fourteen required assets are not duplicated: fresh lower-gate checkpoints/current/average files match indexed #215/#226 bytes, and original seed0601 4B/2B averages restore through accepted #226/#223 archives. Every row in the20-asset index resolves an exact prior archive/member/hash/byte/retrieval command; see also [#226 index](docs/reports/hu100-4b-seed-ladder-artifacts/model-index.json), [#215 index](docs/reports/hu100-independent-stages-artifacts/model-index.json), [#223/#207 input index](docs/reports/hu100-3b-ladder-artifacts/model-input-index.json). Both original candidate/comparator averages were restored from retained hash-verified M4 originals; historical full audits reused explicitly, no absent old checkpoint/current fresh-audit claim.

**Restoration:** download the observed main archive URL into a fresh ignored ARCHIVE.zip, verify the whole SHA, extract only the required member into a fresh RESTORE_ROOT, then verify its model SHA. For seed0901 terminal average:

```sh
shasum -a 256 ARCHIVE.zip
python -c 'import sys,zipfile; zipfile.ZipFile(sys.argv[1]).extract(sys.argv[2],sys.argv[3])' ARCHIVE.zip research/training/2026100901/4000000000/average.gz RESTORE_ROOT
shasum -a 256 RESTORE_ROOT/research/training/2026100901/4000000000/average.gz
```

Expected whole SHA is7cce272f16d292c62c62cdb0ac6b27e007fb51ef1460bb8e04fd9934f686ecb5; expected member SHA2769138651b8fa4400e93bfa64d8d9f8fa35784282fbf07aa1cb6a0ba62968d3. Per-asset commands in the index cover all20inputs. Reconstruct science from Git9516 and continuation sources from research/owner-authorized-continuation-v1/source/; original frozen models/roots/samples and owner authorization are archived.

**Specific authorized cleanup:** after accepted uploads, all audits and exact path/size/mtime/SHA256/no-open-handle checks, only this worktree's three own extracted `results/k50-smoke/tables/*-k50.bin` files were removed (1,384,031,032bytes). [Exact cleanup receipt/restoration links](docs/reports/k50-evaluation-support-artifacts/cleanup-receipt.json). The owner's task explicitly authorizes this particular open-PR action; no general open-root cleanup occurred. Models, downloaded release, original logs, source/build and all synced files/other PR dependencies remain. A receipt-generation helper initially used `member` instead of the manifest's `path` field; it failed before any cleanup, was corrected, and generated the receipts without changing the archive or rerunning science. CI's unrelated uniform-fixture interface failure and repair are documented in the report and PR issue comment; no failed check is bypassed.

## Storage cleanup for K50 evaluation and HU100 replication — October 11, 2026

Owner-requested cleanup for new M1 #235 /M4 #236 tasks left **M1 86.501 GB free** and **M4 97.866 GB free** at verification. M4 released **42.403 GB native uploaded cache** plus **27.749 GB measured original-removal gain**, exceeding the provisional 77.567 GiB campaign forecast; fresh research admission and pilot refinement remain required.

**49 unchanged merged #226 paths** were removed after current #226/#207/#215/#223 merged status, native/cloud upload acceptance and dependency review. [Receipt/safeguards](docs/artifacts/storage-vacuum-20261011.md), [every removed path and restoration archive/member/hash](docs/artifacts/storage-vacuum-20261011-locators.md), [full cleanup receipt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lj6nZVoI8vSlsxY2OYluTdnmPDPCmxp9/view) (444,294 bytes, SHA256 `bc6666cd7ad25c0d9f3a073772462523d97f7214de42a718c2126db2719d4b0b`; confirmed Research-Cloud upload). Existing manifests and byte-exact model receipts were used without remote downloads or repeated research payload audits. Six candidate/reference models, both new work roots, K50 inputs, canonical #207 originals, source/build/Git and changed/unarchived files remain protected.

Four unpinned uploaded cache files retain unchanged cloud files/placeholders with zero allocated blocks. This includes the fully uploaded **incomplete #226 failure ZIP**, whose contents and failure status remain preserved online; it is still unaccepted as a scientific archive, and no original-removal backup depends on it. The accepted recovery ZIP remains #226's scientific backup. The incomplete #207 original cache remains unchanged. Historical “all originals retained” statements are superseded only for the 49 listed paths. No synced deletion, force offload, app shutdown, science retry or unattended maintenance.

## M1/M4 storage cleanup — October 10, 2026

Owner-authorized cleanup for open #225/#226 preserved their roots and current inputs. **M1: 18.497 GB native cache released /41.924 GB free at verification. M4: 32.978 GB native cache released plus 37.051 GB measured original-removal gain /96.163 GB free.** Free space fluctuates; the M4 check exceeds the historical 87.5 GiB campaign estimate, pending pilot refinement.

**819 unchanged manifested M4 original paths** from merged #215/#223, #202 results and #176/#185 copied inputs were removed after live merged status, current native/cloud upload acceptance and dependency review. #223 reference copies restore from #207; #185 copied references restore from #176. Canonical #207 originals/incomplete synced partial, K50 inputs, source/build/Git, active PR work, external links and changed/unarchived files remain protected. Earlier originals-retained descriptions remain historical; this entry and its exact path list supersede them only for the selected 819 paths.

[Receipt and safeguards](docs/artifacts/storage-vacuum-20261010.md), [all removed paths and exact restoration locators](docs/artifacts/storage-vacuum-20261010-locators.md).

[PR223](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/223),
`feature/hu100-3b-ladder`, isolated M4 checkout from main

Executed scientific source `38c83f2eab09b5247a8c16344ce6d0a3d00c43af`;

[raw-evidence summary](docs/reports/hu100-3b-ladder-artifacts/summary.json),
[model/input restoration](docs/reports/hu100-3b-ladder-artifacts/model-input-index.json).

Fresh #207 seed 2026100601 reproduces the indexed 500M and 1B checkpoint hashes
exactly, then reaches **2,000,000,460 nodes /54,626,283 entries**.
The 3B segment was refused prospectively because its measured export workspace
forecast would cross the unchanged disk floor; no actual guard breach, trainer
source change or scientific retry occurred. The native gate remains
`terminal_capacity_stop=false`: this is a preventive admission stop.
All three evaluated checkpoints were stream-exported and fully audited.

The terminal-minus-1B primary passes at **+29.51 [26.82,32.20] BB/100**;
1B-minus-500M is descriptively +38.93 [35.92,41.95].
Each distinct rung has 524,288 independent duplicate blocks, translation off.
The admitted translated secondary uses five opponents, 4,096 blocks each,
512 states/128 events; all five paired gains are inconclusive.
All **2,260,992 final hands** replay and reproduce.
The 9.93-hour full-scope quote was posted before final play.
One fixed training seed supports these conditional comparisons; no release,
default or external-strength qualification follows.

lists all nine exact model hashes, member paths and per-member retrieval commands.
The manifest resolves other SHA-identical aliases; do not create duplicate model ZIP copies.

**Restoration:** download the named ZIP into a fresh ignored working directory,
verify its whole SHA256 with `shasum -a 256 ARCHIVE.zip`, and extract only needed
members. For the 2B average:

```sh

shasum -a 256 RESTORE_ROOT/research/training/2000000000/average.gz
```

Expected model SHA256 is in the table above. Use the separately indexed PR207 ZIP
for the six dependency models and verify each member before use.
Frozen schedules/specifications, full play/replay/reproduction, telemetry,
native full audits, original source reviews and preventive-stop records are

## PR230 owner-requested nine-root partial analysis — October 10

After #230's blind terminal merge, the owner requests analysis of the available outcomes and posting it on that PR. First numeric inspection is recorded at **19:17:03 UTC on October 10**; [the posted analysis](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/230#issuecomment-6101289186) covers exactly the first nine sorted completed roots, fold counts 5/4. No timing pilot or incomplete root is included. Matched K50 − v1 at 3M is **−0.1485 [−0.3181, +0.0341] BB**, and the 10M contrast is **−0.1211 [−0.2692, +0.0388] BB**, with exploratory nine-root intervals.

No remote archive bytes redownloaded. This contains only new derived summaries, all 21 E/Q placements and contrasts, curves, review, helpers and retrieval provenance; no accepted raw inputs, exports or tables are duplicated.

Fresh isolated current-main analysis checkout `~/Local/hu20-equity-bench-partial-analysis`, base `5875ecd36bf0b35abeeb718dba2e7b7f4b6765c4`, branch `feature/hu20-equity-bench-partial-analysis`. Ignored retained inputs: `results/equity-bench-partial-analysis-20261010/inputs`, **29 files**: nine score results from PR230, 18 B/L/P collect/relock results plus input pins and matched freeze from PR222. Every restored path, source archive/member/bytes/SHA and whole/manifest hash is in [partial-restoration.json](docs/reports/hu20-equity-bench-partial-analysis-artifacts/partial-restoration.json). Restoration/analysis command: the shared repository Python runs `planning/analyze_partial_equity.py`; the archived helper performs verified selective extraction and standalone descriptive aggregation. It does not invoke the failed campaign or its full report. Keep these small inputs and outputs; no new cleanup occurs.

To reproduce, download the indexed derived ZIP to a fresh ignored directory, verify its SHA256 and member manifest, extract `planning/analyze_partial_equity.py` and `planning/publish_partial_equity.py`, then retrieve the two accepted input archives at their recorded paths. Each source archive ID and pin is in the helper and restoration receipt. Run the analysis helper from a checkout of the recorded baseline with a fresh `results/equity-bench-partial-analysis-20261010`; it restores only named members and verifies every SHA256 before numeric decoding. The later inspection disclosure leaves all original stop summaries/receipts untouched.

## PR230 owner-authorized frozen scoring continuation — October 10

[PR230](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/230) restores the predetermined five uninspected completed roots from #225's accepted pressure-stop archive and starts the remaining 35 under the owner's explicit 10,000,000,000-byte swap amendment. It stops on AC power at 19:47:10 Madrid with 9/40 complete (five retained, four new), after 2,656.902 seconds. Other guards pass, all frozen science is unchanged, and no numeric outcome, report or classification occurs. Timer disabled, no retry. [Terminal report and authorization](docs/reports/hu20-equity-bench-scoring-continuation.md), [summary](docs/reports/hu20-equity-bench-scoring-continuation-artifacts/final-stopped-summary.json).

The blind pilot completes at 602.803 seconds/root with clean guard/cleanup. [Full quote](docs/reports/hu20-equity-bench-scoring-continuation-artifacts/pilot-quote.json) is posted before the once-only remaining-35 evaluation starts at 17:02:53 UTC, source `0c97db88890783aed5b1dfe3d482189b4c8e538a`, byte-identical reviewed scientific code. [Source/admission/launch](docs/reports/hu20-equity-bench-scoring-continuation-artifacts/evaluation-launch.json). The interrupted fifth new root and both failed operation latches remain preserved. Earlier #222/#225 stops and archives are unchanged.

Accepted terminal archive: `~/Local/Research-Cloud/PR-230-hu20-equity-bench-scoring/hu20-equity-bench-scoring-ac-stop-M1-20261010.zip`, Drive [1qIOW9fJIWWmXEEEQsu4KZJ0fBhH5Ka9y](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qIOW9fJIWWmXEEEQsu4KZJ0fBhH5Ka9y/view), in [PR230 folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fZajb4vTipfV7AnGgiNjkrZM8RL3POgx). **1,195,153 bytes /132 payload members**, SHA256 `eadf2fa3eaa79334227b5e79daeb45e3ca061ad24a47edcb8744ca40b1e13183`; embedded `ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json` SHA256 `f9b86d4ff2d7f1446031369321566922289b18155f24338116771dc202eab6e5`. All local member sizes/SHA256 read back as opaque bytes. [Archive receipt](docs/reports/hu20-equity-bench-scoring-continuation-artifacts/final-archive-receipt.json), [native/cloud acceptance](docs/reports/hu20-equity-bench-scoring-continuation-artifacts/final-cloud-upload.json): uploaded=1, uploading=0, unpaused/no conflicts, independent cloud archive ID/name/size/parent and folder confirmed. Remote archive bytes were not redownloaded. Contains own partial outputs, pilot/runtime evidence and administrative failure history, not restored exports/tables or the 80 prepared-request copies. Those requests reconstruct through the archived helper and localization hashes.

Restoration of this terminal evidence: download the named PR230 ZIP into a fresh ignored `results/` directory, verify its whole SHA256 and embedded manifest, then extract the required `results/equity-bench-scoring-continuation-admitted-20261010/work/eval/<job>/...` or administrative members and verify their member size/SHA256. Five retained root results retain exact #225 member provenance in `continuation.json`; their original native traces remain in #225's accepted archive. Member hashes and job IDs are preserved without score-based selection.

Own extraction (now removed): `~/Local/hu20-equity-bench-scoring-continuation/results/equity-bench-scoring-continuation-20261010/restored`, 281 member files plus 24 aliases, every size/SHA256 verified. Restoration command: the shared repository Python runs `-m planning.restore_scoring` through `scripts.guard_hu20_equity_scoring --name restore --swap-ceiling-bytes 10000000000`. Per-file archive members, SHA256s, retrieval paths and modification times are recorded in the attempt's `restoration.json`, archived at that exact member path; prepare rechecked every member and alias. Both stopped working roots and all partials remain. Historical own restored/runs/reference symlinks require fresh verified retrieval before reuse.

One [independent end evidence/dependency review](docs/reports/hu20-equity-bench-scoring-continuation-artifacts/final-evidence-review.json) is clear, with no findings. Owner-specific cleanup removes only the 305 own extracted input copies after upload acceptance and immediate exact-set/path/size/mtime/SHA and empty-lsof checks: **3,755,888,589 logical bytes including aliases**. [Cleanup receipt](docs/reports/hu20-equity-bench-scoring-continuation-artifacts/final-cleanup-receipt.json) records every removed path, exact archive ID/member/size/SHA and canonical member for aliases. No other PR file or synced file is removed; all scores, native partials, receipts, localizations and prepared requests remain.

Input archive locators and complete model-member pins remain in [#222's model-input index](docs/reports/hu20-equity-bench-artifacts/model-input-index.json): #222 Drive `1CloDY_sTImLcn4lffU5OHWQAdT7RLb37`, archive SHA256 `c1f305a85282330ef14deadb176a8c97a560f0976fb632e75e387da9e265a8f9`; #190 evaluator Drive `1LM6DGFHa56yNQHVyW2_xJVKlnWdqXNx6`, member `inputs/pr149/pooling-engineering-05-mac`, SHA256 `fb32974d9d211fa66001d1efb330ec4af2d825005d24b287dc6cf3c37fa8812f`; #163 tables Drive `1Gl1JYWN0F7KFJbwoKtcA0zB_rUsWWZ6T`, members `hu20-equity-buckets-20261005/{flop,turn,river}-k50.bin`, pinned in the same index. Existing accepted input archives are reused and will not be duplicated in PR230's evidence archive.

Five result files are copied opaquely with whole/archive-manifest/member verification from #225 Drive `1KKCV4dLBJplxi_NVScGTSXgkcHahXhLH`, archive SHA256 `f78c1327d413d519a0da57d99f9cc341f92fea074c3a2465317e85d64f4cd935`, manifest SHA256 `fb6f4bc66d3e16a7b75fb8c890af8f1e16e4b7954b3f6d71eebd8bde27417422`, direct members `results/equity-bench-scoring-admitted-20261010/work/eval/<first-five-frozen-job-IDs>/result.json`.

Exact selected IDs/member hashes and remaining 35 IDs are in `continuation.json`. Nested solver receipts are excluded from root counting. The initial administrative selector failure and its latch remain preserved; corrected source has independent review and 34 passing focused tests. No scoring ran in the failed setup root.

## PR225 fixed-source scoring stopped on system pressure — October 10

The helper-free timing pilot completes in 627.0966 seconds with a full blind quote posted before scoring. Full scoring stops at 15:23 Madrid after 3,129.1473 seconds and **5/40 completed roots**, on normal→warning system pressure. Peak whole-family RSS 4,058,202,112 bytes stays below 7 GiB; AC/swap/disk pass. [Summary](docs/reports/hu20-equity-bench-scoring-artifacts/final-pressure-stopped-summary.json), [executed source](docs/reports/hu20-equity-bench-scoring-artifacts/final-executed-source.json), [report](docs/reports/hu20-equity-bench-scoring.md). No numeric outcomes inspected, primary decision, report command or scientific retry. Scheduler disabled; failure latch and all partials preserved.

Ignored run `results/equity-bench-scoring-admitted-20261010` used its own verified input copies at `results/equity-bench-scoring-fixed-20261010/restored` through a symlink. Those extracted copies are now removed after accepted archival and dependency review; all run outputs/receipts/latches remain. All 281 members /24 aliases /three K50 tables match. Its earlier prospective 9 GiB headroom refusal launched no evaluator and remains separate. Restoration provenance remains in each run's `restoration.json`; original [PR222 model/input index](docs/reports/hu20-equity-bench-artifacts/model-input-index.json), [PR190 evaluator index](#pr190-global-equity-bucket-validation-october-8) and [PR163 K50 report](docs/reports/native-equity-bucket-keys.md) retain input member hashes and locators. Do not duplicate these inputs in the partial archive.

Remote archive bytes not redownloaded.

For partial-run retrieval, download the indexed Drive ZIP into a fresh ignored directory, verify its whole SHA256, then use `python -m zipfile -e <archive.zip> <fresh-results-directory>` and verify every extracted member against `ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json`. `results/equity-bench-scoring-fixed-20261010/restoration.json` inside this ZIP pins every original PR222/190/163 input archive ID/member/hash and `restoration_command`; `planning/restore_scoring.py` records the exact restoration recipe. No input payload is duplicated. The [single end evidence review](docs/reports/hu20-equity-bench-scoring-artifacts/final-pressure-evidence-review.json) is clear. Following accepted upload and dependency review, immediate exact path-set/size/mtime/SHA256/open-handle checks pass; **only 305 own extracted copies** are removed, 3,755,888,589 logical bytes including aliases.

it verifies archives and every selected member before use.

The actual timing pilot launches, then stops after **10.8885 seconds** on

## PR225 preparation error resolved — October 10

The historical preparation stop below compared #222's obsolete setup pin.
The accepted archive's later `research/qualified-final-source.json` (390 bytes,
SHA256 `62bf82f01cf0c14a204d73eab2e810013cbc6f68ce055a59c48be2c5e5e35956`)
and final launcher explicitly qualify `fb32974d…8812f`, identical to the
published locator and restored evaluator. [Resolution](docs/reports/hu20-equity-bench-scoring-artifacts/evaluator-identity-resolution.json).
That erroneous setup and its archive remain preserved. Fresh ignored root
`results/equity-bench-scoring-qualified-20261010` restores the qualification
alongside the same selected scientific inputs with `python -m planning.restore_scoring`.
The one independent pre-scoring review confirms the correction. This does not
retry failed science: no scoring pass was launched by either earlier setup.

## PR220 v0.5.0 HU100 candidate readiness — owner-authorized merge, October9

[PR220](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/220),

The owner subsequently requested merge. The earlier unmerged handoff is superseded
by the PR’s current host state after renewed final-head checks. Main now includes

unchanged valid-HU100 behavior. Frozen M4/package evidence still names source155;
no retained-model rerun, archive mutation or publication approval follows.

Restore sidecars separately from their Drive subfolder into a fresh ignored path
preserving recorded relative names; verify SIDECAR-MANIFEST's pinned digest, then
each sidecar's byte count/SHA256 from the linked compact manifest. Evidence restores
journals/sources/environment/metadata, not the model; restore that independent #207
member with its pinned helper. Candidate package can be reproduced from source155
and exact model bytes; frozen/readiness sources are deliberately distinct.

Owner/later agent completes native/cloud sidecar upload acceptance and dependency
review. Originals, synced archives, active inputs and shared Git are retained;
no cleanup deletion is authorized by this open PR handoff.

## M1 inactive worktree retirement — October 9, 2026

Owner-authorized cleanup retired **57 worktrees** unused for 24 hours after active/open-PR, process, thread and dependency review. **17.428 GB measured removal-batch reclamation /30.323 GB free** immediately afterward. Source commits and branches remain in shared Git. [Receipt and accepted archives](docs/artifacts/m1-worktree-cleanup-20261009.md) · [compact restoration locators](docs/artifacts/m1-worktree-cleanup-20261009-locators.md) · [complete path/member/stat receipt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J1OsjpghvHUmhxSEnmdkpnzqChKSCNmb/view?usp=drivesdk) (7,561,003 bytes, SHA256 `edf33765bf1ac80faec1da8419bfbca79dca5c642078aa935c431b3e94d41379`).

Twelve merged-PR evidence roots are now retired with current native/cloud upload acceptance. New immutable snapshots preserve previously unarchived PR193 spectator and PR174 Luna-versus-Shield evidence, PR199 publication copies, and late metadata for #105/#109/#112/#166/#188/#190/#200/#201/#202. PR190/PR202 primary members reuse existing confirmed archives and manifests; changed/late records are sealed separately. Their archived failures, private journals, input/model locators and restore commands remain available through the receipt. Expired local test tokens and disposable isolated browser state are excluded; the original Luna agent rollout outside the worktree is untouched. The PR174 snapshot includes its exact model copy, independently of the historical PR171 local locator.

All new archive/member bytes passed local readback; native uploaded/not-uploading/no-conflict/not-trashed status and independent cloud ID/name/size/parent/private permissions match. Confirmed Drive uploads were trusted without remote downloads or repeated old archive/member audits. Active/recent/dirty roots, #218 and its dependencies, maintained configuration/runtime references, shared Git and synced files remain protected. Two otherwise old roots remain for maintained dependencies. Earlier campaign statements that local roots were retained or upload acceptance was pending are dated history; this receipt is the current cleanup/restore record for the selected paths. No unattended cleanup was scheduled.

## PR215 HU100 independent stages — science complete, October 9

byte counts/SHA256s, old #207 averages, #211 partial, native binary/source and
strict result. Actual new averages are canonical snapshot members; **do not
assume `zipfile -e` recreates training aliases**. Restore with the pinned helper.

Using the project Python 3.11 environment, after downloading this archive into
a fresh ignored nonsynced root, this command
verifies whole/manifest/member hashes and restores all canonical bytes plus
aliases without overwrite or automatic science:

```sh
python -m scripts.restore_hu100_staged_archive \
  --archive results/retrieved/pr215/NEW_ROOT/campaign.zip \
  --destination results/retrieved/pr215/NEW_ROOT/unpacked \

```

For a selective recovery, add e.g.
`--member research/training/2026100902/terminal/checkpoint.gz`
and `--member research/training/2026100902/terminal/average.gz`; the helper
extracts the average's canonical snapshot and recreates the requested alias.
Use each other exact member from the asset index for its corresponding retrieval.
Source/configs retain original path identities; resolve retrieved assets by their
pinned SHA256 when adapting a separately authorized run. Never relaunch the
one-use controller or overwrite an active input automatically.

`shasum -a 256 results/retrieved/pr211/NEW_ROOT/campaign.zip` and require the

### Historical preparation refusals (superseded by execution above)

## HU100 independent-seed qualification preparation — October 9, 2026

**Live execution supersedes the dated preparation refusals below:** owner
authorized launch; exact source `b51db57c402df116e3acc370b9f3247b1cea1ac2`
passed independent review. M4 clock08:41–14:41UTC,301stable samples,
normalpressure/86%free/AC/about110.5GiBdisk. The bounded first-seed pilot saves
1,000,373actualnodes/465,321entries; main qualification is not yet admitted.
New root `~/Local/hu100-seed-qualification-20261009`, #207 `.venv`/binary/source
and sharedGit are active dependencies; preserve all. Old early/terminal averages
were copied with exact merged-index byte/SHA256/full-audit binding; archive
member pointers remain unchanged and the offloaded ZIP was not hydrated.
No1Bnewseed/finaloutcome/cloudarchive acceptance or recipe qualification is
claimed. Later outcome/archive receipts will replace this live snapshot.

[PR211](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/211),
`feature/hu100-seed-qualification`, [prospective protocol](docs/hu100-seed-qualification.md),
[blocked preflight report](docs/reports/hu100-seed-qualification.md) and
[compact live status receipt](docs/reports/hu100-seed-qualification-artifacts/preflight.json).
**Storage planning:** [full inventory estimate](docs/reports/hu100-seed-qualification-artifacts/storage-planning-20261009.json)
requires 110 GiB free at 4,096 blocks or 130 GiB at 8,192, versus latest
29.448 GiB free (80.552/100.552 GiB additional). Fixed snapshots and variable
raw traces are separated; originals plus archives, reserves and the floor are
included. ZIP directory/small manifest only read, pinned manifest SHA matches;
no model/raw/whole ZIP scan, extraction/copy/mutation/cleanup. This is a
conservative planning estimate, not final pilot/time admission or new evidence
archive; it supersedes the prior model-only planning target below.
**October 9 05:46 UTC refresh:** [readiness/disk reference](docs/reports/hu100-seed-qualification-artifacts/readiness-20261009.json)
confirms #207's separately reviewed local archive/failure/evidence closeout
resolved, upload acceptance owner-delegated and final dependency CI pending
at that dated snapshot. Later final green CI admitted #207 merge `6e68bc9`,
now integrated here with its restoration index and evidence preserved.
Fresh M4 free disk is 23.841 GiB; saved model originals plus one archive copy
at #207's reference sizes and the fixed floor require 32.865 GiB, **9.024 GiB
short before inputs/raw evaluation/reproduction/partials/headroom**. This is
not a full quote or a guaranteed lower bound for new seeds. No dependent
computation, model/ZIP read, copy or cleanup started; all prior evidence stays.

Historical initial refusal: #207 was open/draft with unresolved archive
swap stop and no accepted archive/final evidence closeout. Its fixed science
remains in its [PR/report](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/207).
The incomplete M4 synced ZIP remains 3,354,661,317 bytes/mtime 1791496020;
all originals and the failure latch are preserved. No copying/retry/cleanup or
new swap baseline. Brief idle-host snapshots are not stable campaign admission.

Preparation fixes fresh seeds 2026100901/2026100902 alongside #207 seed
2026100601, with prospective early/1B comparisons and one six-hour budget.
The owner's subsequent swap-growth guard is 3 GB (3,000,000,000 bytes) above
this new campaign's fixed admission baseline; #207's historical stop persists.
No new models/raw research payloads/archives were created; archive IDs, accepted
member paths/hashes, upload evidence and retrieval commands for this campaign
are **not yet available**. Do not use #207's partial ZIP as a restoration source.
Measured full quote and execution remain gated on disk capacity and fresh
stable/exclusive admission; the new PR
stays unmerged, without an automatic launch or release recommendation.

## Storage vacuum — October 9, 2026

Owner-requested cleanup removed **392 M4 paths /6.014 GB logical** and **41 M1 paths /1.098 GB logical**, after fresh merged-PR/upload acceptance and dependency checks. Measured removal-batch free gains **6.035 GB M4 /1.086 GB M1**; immediate free space **31.619 GB /35.481 GB**. Removed archived #197/#200/#203/#204 inactive pilot/per-panel copies and raw final/reproduction traces on M4; archived #165 inactive pilot/arena copies and #208 closeout staging/duplicate ZIP on M1. Canonical recovery/model inputs, shared Git, open #210–#213 roots/dependencies and **entire #207 root** remain protected.

[Cleanup/restoration guide](docs/artifacts/storage-vacuum-20261009.md) · [compact measurements](docs/artifacts/storage-vacuum-20261009.json) · [full exact-path/member/hash restoration receipt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KJU6cRbeHcuBv6asxGcMxZIQv79znWcx/view?usp=drivesdk). Current native uploaded/no-pending/no-conflicts/exact-size and independent cloud ID/name/size/parent agree for all eight canonical archives. Existing manifests, recorded sizes/stat/modification history and provenance were used without archive downloads or repeated payload hash audits. Receipt upload/metadata readback accepted. Historical retention notes are superseded only for these exact paths; no synced deletion/offloading, process interruption or unattended cleanup.

## PR212 retained HU100 terminal average retrieval — October 9, 2026

[PR212](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/212)
remains open and unmerged. #207's reviewed head is now
`fbe19c17f0fbd474e5ea26393cc16c9ddeafaf27`, ready for merge after CI; its repaired

were freshly verified read-only before streaming selected member
`research/training/1000000000/average.gz` to M1. **Remote cloud bytes were not

are distinct from the existing canonical archive's byte/member verification.

The selected **1,173,264,021-byte** model verifies SHA256
`47d493c2ca0a750ffec8ba5490bd8fdec0a582e0cf2fe3e4309868f6ae620fa9`
at `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu100-local-runtime/models/retrieved/pr207-20261009/average.gz`.
Retrieval helper, remote verification log and resource receipt are retained at
`/Users/dberweger/Local/hu100-local-runtime/results/hu100-retained-smoke/`.
Exact command from that worktree:
`/Users/dberweger/Local/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/.venv/bin/python results/hu100-retained-smoke/retrieve_pr207.py`.
The helper performs read-only SSH streaming from the fully allocated canonical
M4 Research-Cloud ZIP, checks archive/manifest/member pins, creates a fresh ignored
target and enforces total swap <3,000,000,000 bytes and a 15.5-GiB M1 disk floor.
It is retained for archival provenance; future retrieval may instead download the
same pinned Drive ZIP and verify those hashes before extracting the named member.
No original, synced partial or other campaign dependency was changed. No cleanup
or forced offloading is authorized. Runtime evidence and these active dependencies
remain protected while PR212 is open; runtime archive closeout remains pending.

Retained runtime source `8f90697c` (full revision in the
[compact verification receipt](docs/reports/hu100-runtime-retained-verification.json))
passes **80 complete 100BB hands** through HTTP: 20 human-seat plus 20 spectator
per translation setting. Four new successful HTTP workers per setting recovered
durable state; two lost-reply retries were identical across different PIDs.
Both settings cover off-menu 550 raises and all-in calls, with eight translated
witnesses in the enabled human-seat run. Translation-disabled human hands have
no all-in calls; the spectator provides that coverage. Policy-reproducing journal
audits and independent evidence review pass, with no open findings. Of 593 HTTP
responses, 589 succeeded and four were expected identity/configuration rejections.
Load took 230.97 seconds with warmed filesystem cache; one validated compact
model was inherited by workers, so this is not separate cold-CLI-start evidence.
Sampled summed fork RSS peak 2.554 GB (shared pages may be counted twice), maximum
total swap 1.606 GB, minimum disk 34.696 GB; all guards passed. A missing declared
psutil dependency and a pre-hand helper lookup defect are preserved in the same
ignored root with the stopped-load receipt; no retained hand failed. Model,
raw HTTP/private journals, helpers, resource samples and failures remain indexed
by path/size/SHA256 in the compact receipt. Final run and workers are stopped.

## PR212 HU100 local-runtime fixture verification — October 9, 2026

[PR212](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/212)
is open; retain its isolated worktree and dependencies. Source branch
`feature/hu100-local-runtime`, implementation base `a2ee720a81070f2b6b7b7c711bb5732e84aad8cf`
plus the reviewed final protocol/validation changes. The completed local browser
fixture at `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu100-local-runtime/results/hu100-runtime-smoke/`
retains generated miniature averages, its server helper and human/spectator SQLite
journals. [Compact receipt](docs/reports/hu100-runtime-fixture-verification.json)
records every file's bytes/SHA256 and independent replay of two complete 100BB
hands. It includes the initial Host rejection and corrected loopback navigation;
no hand failed. The fixture server is stopped.

This is test-fixture evidence, not retained #207 model qualification, training or
a benchmark campaign. No research binary/database is committed. Archive closeout
and an actual Research-Cloud folder/archive ID are pending while this PR remains
open; no upload, retrieval or deletion is claimed. Preserve the local root until
its owning PR permits closeout under `docs/artifact-storage.md`. The owner-approved
swap cap is 3 GB. At this earlier fixture snapshot #207 was draft/open at
`f0ff3c1ffc4f0002a0c7ab22751d212aa76cdda3`;
its unaccepted partial archive is not a retrieval source and M4 remains untouched.
The exact required policy pin and gated follow-up are in
[the local-play guide](docs/hu100-local-play.md).

## PR208 HU20 turn-search stackoff diagnosis — October 8, 2026

[PR208](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/208) · [report](docs/reports/hu20-search-stackoff-diagnosis.md). Final recorded-hand diagnosis on M1; scientific implementation/review `84b1048de1c68678451235859e4027877b771d55`, fresh main base `9da625f`, later #209 metadata integrated. All 3,072 selective hands /9,552 decisions replay exactly; nine original-request-matched offline solves reproduce recorded probabilities with error 0.0. Joint −10.35 BB/100, 13-panel adjusted interval [−22.99,+2.29]: plausible regression, not established. No large opposing late bets occur. Re-solves expose mis-modeled value callers and future folds, alongside heterogeneous missed-value/runout contributions. No new arena/sweep/training/default/native-trainer change or M4 use. One independent review clears all scientific calculations; ten focused tests pass.

[Receipt](docs/reports/hu20-search-stackoff-diagnosis/metadata-archive-receipt.json) · [acceptance](docs/reports/hu20-search-stackoff-diagnosis/metadata-archive-acceptance.json). Preserves completed main archive/copy guards and late setup failures, primary acceptance, exact-path cleanup, compact provenance/review/report/index snapshots and operational helpers. Restore by its pinned ID/hash with the same member procedure. Own metadata creation/copy guards and self-indexing acceptance remain local/checked-in closeout receipts; no science is rerun or archive rebuilt.

Primary members include `analysis/{selective-hands,contrasts,summary,lbr-scope,native-pressure-scope}.json`, `offline/range-rows/`, all nine local `offline/solves/<id>/{request.json,profile.jsonl,response.jsonl,receipt.json,manifest.json}`, selected frozen `offline/requests/`, provenance, source/tests/report snapshots, independent review and all scientific failures/guard logs. No bulky original compressed arena traces, model files or nested original tarballs are duplicated. Archive/report snapshots precede final self-indexing acceptance/cleanup and final-head CI; the checked-in receipts and live PR state are authoritative.

Restore primary outputs: download the pinned Drive file to a fresh ignored directory, verify `shasum -a 256 <zip>` against the hash above, then extract named members with `python -m zipfile -e <zip> <fresh-results-path>` and verify sizes/SHA256 against the embedded manifest. To re-run the scientific analysis, restore the original [PR166 ZIP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yfRZuDep2yOnAhZGylYSB4jXshTNzXmQ/view), 5,645,638,363 bytes /SHA256 `cac0d2a766a8d0276820662112b68bb12ffe3688b8597faa0f63d43a829b3a0e`, from folder `1iVCttvjpYo8X4jD9C3tcflLyT_Y9QBqO`. It was hydrated locally and whole-ZIP verified before any member extraction. Its native uploaded/no-pending/no-conflicts status and independent cloud metadata were freshly rechecked at closeout; no second remote payload download was used for acceptance. [Exact input/request/model provenance](docs/reports/hu20-search-stackoff-diagnosis/input-provenance.json) lists all 43 selected top-level members and nine nested original requests with bytes/hashes. Run `python -m scripts.run_hu20_search_stackoff_diagnosis restore --root results/<fresh-name> --archive <original-zip>`, then `analyze`, `retrieve` (same archive), `resolve` (pinned external binary) and `tests` with the same root. The wrapper applies nice-15, M1-only, ignored/non-synced root, 4 GiB family/pressure/reserve/swap/disk guards; AC is required unless the owner explicitly supplies the documented waiver.

All models come from original ZIP member `fixed-work-bundle.tar.gz` (**563,547,890 bytes**, SHA256 `ef03a73ae1ae7d6632821e2a06436962127bb77a1a883df877d98611f929a02b`), nested members below. `retrieve` verifies the outer member; `resolve` materializes only inference files and verifies their pinned hashes. No checkpoint is needed.

It was reused unchanged, not rebuilt or modified. Python/engine dependencies follow [development](docs/development.md).

Failures preserved: initial hydration timeout and whole-ZIP hash-gate failure during hydration, then verified complete restoration; AC admission stopped before any native solve, corrected to the owner’s explicit power waiver; LBR rival-first attribution and unsupported-row floor-analysis assumptions corrected without new hands; one test-fixture error corrected; final metadata wrong-suffix lookup and copy-helper module-path failure occurred before mutation and are receipted separately. Completed native solves were reused only after their member hashes verified; no failed arena hand was rerun.

[Own-extracted-copy cleanup receipt](docs/reports/hu20-search-stackoff-diagnosis/cleanup-receipt.json) records every removed absolute path, size/mtime/inode and exact restoration archive/member/hash. Under the task’s specific authorization, after the derived and original archives’ current acceptance and completed reviewer dependency clearance, only this PR’s `results/stackoff-diagnosis/{inputs,offline}/` copies were removed: **2,674,293,859 logical bytes**, measured free space **34,066,780,160→36,785,741,824 bytes**. No synced file was removed/evicted; the hydrated original PR166 ZIP, external solver, shared Git, all other PR roots and local derived/staging/guard/archive copies remain. No unattended cleanup follows.

## Storage vacuum — October 8, 2026

Owner-requested cleanup removed **154 M4 paths /23.868 GB logical** and **52 M1 paths /1.545 GB logical**, after fresh merged-PR/upload acceptance and dependency checks. Measured removal-batch free-space gains: **23.884 GB M4 /1.059 GB M1**; immediate free space **77.664 GB /41.343 GB**. Eight M4 completed nonsynced ZIP copies, archived PR202/PR205 outputs, and M1 archived PR201 copies/outputs were removed. All canonical synced archives, active HU100/turn-search/bucket work, recovery checkpoints, inputs, shared Git and uncertain files remain.

Existing manifests/provenance and original path/size/modification history were used without archive downloads or repeated payload hash audits. Receipt upload and metadata readback accepted. Historical original-retention notes are superseded only for these receipted paths; no synced deletion/offloading, research-process changes or unattended cleanup.

## PR204 HU100 growth toward 50M and paired playing gains — October 8

[PR204](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/204) **open, unmerged**.

Same seed/RNG/recovery/regrets/averaging/menu/abstraction/fallback. Normal audited metadata and pinned ignored runtime integration fixed with focused regressions; no exceptional reporting route. Stage 1 clean capacity stop **39,438,279 actual nodes /7,643,261 entries**, entry ceiling **7,642,767 /494 complete-iteration overshoot**. **50M not reached.** Native atomic save 24.68s, streaming exports 77.34s, full audits 170.72s; 200-ms train/save family peak 3.026 GiB. The RSS/entry coefficient rose 18.23% versus pilot; actual memory stayed below unchanged 5.63/10-GiB guards. Applying the same capacity formula afresh yields 6,464,366 planning entries, below the new parent. Native table/save measurement and engineering should precede further growth; this does not prove 50M cannot fit.

Stage 1 includes retrieval, pilot, exact pilot recovery, continuation, save, exports, audits, archive verification and native copy: **475.71 seconds** of its 1,800-second cap. Stage 2 separate **412.23 seconds** of 1,800, timing-only freeze 2,048 blocks/opponent /61,440 distinct hand evaluations. All final play fully replayed/reproduced; strict normal reporter succeeds. Primaries terminal−fixed 20M parent: tight **+22.90 [−21.05,66.85]**, inconclusive; loose **+105.68 [21.62,189.73] BB/100**, improvement, Bonferroni 97.5% intervals. Remaining opponents descriptive. Terminal loose/pot still lose; visits improve but remain sparse; support unchanged. One scripted-opponent lineage. No failures, admission refusals, retries, selection or outcome extension.

[PR203](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/203) **merged October 8 at 14:57:20 UTC**, commit `8fcde7767d0febe34e9fae9d530b5ba6136d17a3`, after independent review and all five checks passed on final head `d93c16d0268bc166cf4ed1c1771caa9a52732267`. [Protocol](docs/native-hu100-growth.md) · [report](docs/reports/native-hu100-growth.md). Stage 1 source `f5791b56f445a6f6081884a4b1074fd626568133` resumed the exact #197 recovery state to **20,001,470 actual nodes /4,937,867 entries**, with a 1,470-node complete-iteration overshoot, no entry overshoot and full current/average audits. Stage 1 local science/archive closeout completed in **305.18 seconds** of its 1,800-second cap. Stage 2 fixed 2,048 blocks/opponent /61,440 distinct final hands, fully replayed/reproduced, and verified separate postprocessing/archive closeout at **914.25 seconds** of its original separate cap. Both aggressive primaries improve: tight +65.31 [23.04, 107.58], loose +162.73 [80.93, 244.54] BB/100, Bonferroni-adjusted. Terminal loose/pot still lose; this is one scripted-opponent lineage. Initial never-started setup failure and later dirty-binary summary refusal remain preserved; original evaluation launcher remains failed, while separate exact-source-bound postprocessing is verified. No hands repeated or sample extension.

[Fresh retrieval receipt](docs/reports/native-hu100-growth-artifacts/retrieval.json) records original members, sizes/hashes and local paths.

Live #197 merged status and embedded manifest/member equality verified before copying. Native synced input may hydrate on read; no separate connector byte download is claimed.

Restore the Stage 1 ZIP by its Drive ID into a fresh ignored nonsynced directory; require the whole SHA256 above with `shasum -a 256 DOWNLOADED_ZIP`, then `python3 -m zipfile -e DOWNLOADED_ZIP results/retrieved/pr203/NEW_ROOT`. Require manifest SHA256 and every selected member's byte count/SHA256 before use. `research/source.tar` holds frozen source; `research/bin/hu20-trainer` pins the runtime binary. `research/science-closeout.json` freezes pre-archive operation state; final archive guard/upload metadata are separate receipts. Restore the original source into a separate checkout and adapt paths for explicit manual tool commands; never automatically rerun the one-use campaign launcher. Primary archive excludes its own mutable archive supervisor files; the accepted later metadata seal preserves those separately.

## PR202 HU100 export and audit memory (October 8)

[PR #202](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/202) completes the export/audit memory reduction; **owner-authorized merge follows green final-head checks and clear independent reviews**.

[Report](docs/reports/hu100-export-audit-memory.md) · [protocol](docs/hu100-export-audit-memory.md). Final production source `506743412fdbf7ec2cb3f4a1069b68d0effcb538`; later edits are harness admission logging, tests and documentation. Largest HU100 (11,042,440 actual nodes /3,255,387 entries): sampled whole-family export **3.172 →0.101 GiB**, audit **4.668 →0.141 GiB**, with approximately 2× time. All six inputs preserve compressed native current/average bytes, Python extraction bytes and complete audit receipts.

Science/verification finished at 1,550.88 seconds, archive local verification/copy at 1,601.74 seconds of the original 1,800-second budget; subsequent asynchronous upload acceptance involved no new science. Initial setup failure and fresh-headroom refusal/never-started continuation remain disclosed. No training or guard increase.

Later reports, compact receipts, changed source modules/tests, admission fix, native upload acceptance and dated pre-final CI snapshot are sealed separately; manifest pins `6933530` and files, without changing frozen production source or primary ZIP. This M1 metadata-only work followed the scientific cap and restarted no M4 computation. Restore using the same whole-ZIP/manifest/member procedure. Its RESULTS_INDEX snapshot predates this self-indexing entry; current checked-in receipts are authoritative. No remote-byte download or final-head CI snapshot is claimed by this ZIP.

Fresh inputs were restored from the accepted merged #197 [followup ZIP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kMXJIUUB6YkYphhHSKsRp3Xacz_Oxno2/view) and [resource-stop ZIP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hNbCAU71BcYFxVBx2OSmqYtp0sXfhmcS/view), verifying whole ZIPs, embedded manifests and every selected member. [Retrieval receipt](docs/reports/hu100-export-audit-memory-artifacts/retrieval.json) pins all 18 original Drive IDs/member paths/sizes/SHA256 and local retrieval paths; it does not claim remote-byte retrieval. In the new primary ZIP these exact inputs are `results/inputs/<basename from local_path>`, including largest HU100 `hu100-11042440-checkpoint.gz` (114,633,184 bytes /SHA256 `234628a0390502f6b17f4bad3486c47c2a5aa7a297fc611e00287533ea1f4567`) and HU20 `hu20-reference-1b-checkpoint.gz` (214,220,678 bytes /SHA256 `4ee91d3977d98c0b6b462ed310396c6a7cbba48ef51716bb0fdbf6609dfbc825`). Source tar/binary identities, all before/initial/final outputs, raw 200-ms family samples, 5-second guard samples, pilots, failures and one-use continuation claims are preserved under `results/` and `bin/`.

Restore into a new ignored nonsynced directory: download the primary ZIP by its pinned Drive ID, then `shasum -a 256 DOWNLOADED_ZIP` and require the whole hash above. Run `python3 -m zipfile -e DOWNLOADED_ZIP results/retrieved/pr202/NEW_ROOT`; verify both compressed/decompressed manifest hashes and the sizes/SHA256 of every needed member against that manifest before use. Inputs additionally match the retrieval receipt. Extract each retained source tar separately; reuse frozen execution source and commands, not an automatic benchmark/training relaunch. Do not restore into another agent's root.

[Capacity estimate](docs/reports/hu100-export-audit-memory-artifacts/capacity.json) recommends a separately approved 30-minute free-M4 growth experiment toward 20M total nodes, at most 6,510,774 entries, one terminal checkpoint/audit set and unchanged guards. Training/save reserve 5.63 GiB, tools 0.62 GiB, additional disk 9.63 GiB plus retained inputs/15.5-GiB floor; fresh pilot admission required. This is advisory, limited to 2× measured HU100 entries, and gives no 1B/10B promise. Native table/save growth is the next memory bottleneck; average inference remains compact. M4 own root `~/Local/hu100-export-audit-memory-20261008` and M1 feature/baseline isolated checkouts remain intact. No cleanup, model Git addition, training or unattended work.

## PR201 HU100 coverage and aggressive-loss diagnosis — October 8

[PR201](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/201),
[concise report](docs/reports/native-hu100-diagnosis.md), [protocol](docs/native-hu100-diagnosis.md),
[compact evidence/CSV](docs/reports/native-hu100-diagnosis-artifacts/scientific-summary.json).
All five #200 average checkpoints and all **102,400 candidate hands /396,161
actions /177,171 target decisions** diagnose coverage without new arena/training
or policy changes. All actions/settlements replay; native parity has zero
mismatched hands. All cells and disjoint hand-payoff partitions independently
recount. Thirty-six focused tests, artifact checks and independent source/evidence
review pass. Five illustrative/native-witness fixtures add 33 passing decisions.
Source `16ad96c34a449cb021e004b9231e38573837421c`; exact supplemental report/example
sources and their hashes are preserved separately in the evidence archive.

Final pot_pressure has 918 missing decisions: 910 exhaustively unsupported
history/menu cases and eight supported but absent. Off-menu actions alone were
never proof; 23 alternate-menu witnesses occur across checkpoints. Tight/loose
aggressive losses concentrate in all-positive-mass hands. Full-sample associations
are descriptive, not causal benefits from adding support or more training.
Rank: action/history support, bounded training after memory work, further
averaging/abstraction investigation, encoding fixes only upon a demonstrated issue.
No unresolved cases, training, policy/rules changes, cleanup, scheduling or merge.

The fresh M1 1,800-second absolute cap includes retrieval, timing-only pilot,
fixed full-sample diagnosis, native build/parity, tests, independent verification
and complete archive readback. Scientific/archive guard closeout finished in
**838.17 seconds**, with no budget reset or resource failure. Measured M1 limits
are 4-GiB family RSS, 24.29-GiB disk floor, original swap baseline/+0.25 GiB,
normal system pressure and AC. [Final resources](docs/reports/native-hu100-diagnosis-artifacts/final-resources.json).

Connector upload refused its100-MiB transport limit before invocation; verified

Inputs were restored read-only from #200's accepted archive after live MERGED
checks for #197/#200; its whole ZIP, both manifest hashes and **205 selected

The previously dataless native file hydrated on read; no independent connector
raw-byte download was performed. [Transport clarification](docs/reports/native-hu100-diagnosis-artifacts/retrieval-transport-correction.json)
corrects the original receipt's ambiguous remote-download field. Prior evidence

are in `inputs/retrieval.json` → `index.models` and #200's existing model index.
Raw panels are `inputs/research/hu100-learning-curves/run-01/{pilot,final}/{actual_nodes}/{opponent}/`.
Full derived features/hand accounting/native fixtures/cells/search proofs live
under `analysis/`; `failure-examples.json` and `example-native-fixtures.jsonl`
preserve representative paths/witnesses. `source.tar`, `native-parity-binary`,
`native-binary.json`, `supplemental-source.json` and the two adjacent Python
sources pin execution; `budget.json`, `frozen-analysis.json`, `guard-*`, pilot
and original transport correction preserve timing/admission/verification.
Use the report's analysis/parity/verify commands under a separately authorized
budget; restoration does not automatically restart the one-use campaign.

## PR190 global equity-bucket validation (October 8)

**Validation complete:** global K50 passes at **0.3917 BB [0.3614, 0.4234]**, versus fitted50 0.3874 and v1 0.6567. Global K200 is descriptively worse at 0.4233 [0.3795, 0.4740]. All 120 collections/120 held-out locks/18 replays qualify; every coverage cell passes and the independent raw/bootstrap audit agrees within 4.44e-16. [Report](docs/reports/hu20-global-bucket-validation.md), [compact evidence](docs/artifacts/pr190-validation-readout.json). The original swap stop, failed storage admission and interrupted output remain preserved. Owner-authorized continuation retained the original baseline/deadline and completed on October 8 at 10:39 CEST. No training or production key change.

**Execution provenance:** final frozen study attempt `continuation-01`, source revision `b3de451a01485c46d91f333b1128040e9257cb90`; `continuation-execution-source.tar.gz` in the final evidence ZIP has SHA256 `aad8556e13c9c7e9cf3c7c2abefe5f5316294967ffa72d9095d0b7081a99ea67`. Its adjacent `.json` pins launcher, admission, authorization and original budget hashes. The original failed attempt remains separate. The prepared global schedule is `prepared/manifest.json`, 134,997 bytes, SHA256 `476d0c08e043056e2073b1b858d36c1291541c16c5a81e1b908daa8f3cdcfaf6`, in the verified input ZIP.

All **258 native payload ZIPs** (120 collection, 120 lock, 18 replay; 5,181,180,575 total ZIP bytes) freshly pass archive/raw-member SHA256 checks, native upload acceptance and a matching Drive folder metadata listing. Each archive's exact Drive ID/URL, name, size, raw hash, ZIP hash and manifest hash is in `native-archive-inventory-20261008.json`, SHA256 `ab3d92b856eb03376b08aea0df2f159aa1d83d3f34a3e1249b80ea52462b6cc4`, inside the final evidence ZIP. Payload names are `native-<collect|relock|replay>-<spot-hash>-<lineage-index>.zip`; each has raw member `response.jsonl` and member-hashed `ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json`. The inventory pins every job instead of relying on a filename pattern alone.

Restore into a fresh ignored local directory: verify the chosen ZIP SHA256 against this receipt/inventory, read `ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json` with Python `zipfile.ZipFile(archive)`, and stream `archive.open(member)` to the destination; verify SHA256 and byte count against the member manifest before use. For gzip members, verify the encoded member first, then decompress and verify the raw hash in its adjacent receipt. Retrieve raw native ZIPs by their pinned Drive URLs, verify ZIP and `response.jsonl` hashes, and rebind absolute paths only inside the restored copy. Never overwrite/delete synced evidence. The final evidence manifest's `previous_archive_references` resolves unchanged inputs by exact archive/member/hash.

The input/preparation/pilot ZIP retains the exact four full-deck table members `inputs/tables/turn-k50.bin`, `turn-k200.bin`, `river-k50.bin`, `river-k200.bin`; their raw hashes and retrieval provenance are in the embedded manifest and preparation receipts.

## PR200 HU100 checkpoint learning curves — completed evidence, October 8, 2026

[PR200](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/200),
[protocol](docs/native-hu100-learning-curves.md), [report and exportable plots](docs/reports/native-hu100-learning-curves.md).
All five averages retained at **100,691; 1,001,382; 5,001,210; 10,001,922; 11,042,440 actual nodes**.
The last is the verified capacity stop, not its requested-1B filename. No training,
model changes, checkpoint selection or release claim. **122,880 distinct final
hands /477,296 actions**, plus 960 excluded pilot hands, all replay/reproduce.
Uniform plays once/opponent; exact rows are reused. Twenty final-minus-earlier
comparisons use Bonferroni FWER0.05: only final−100k against check_call improves,
**+75.90 [+16.79, +135.01] BB/100**; 19 inconclusive. Every checkpoint loses to
the three aggressive opponents; better coverage does not consistently improve
profit. The initial reviewed handoff left the PR unmerged; the owner subsequently
authorized merging. No further research or cleanup follows this task.

M4 isolated root `~/Local/hu100-learning-curves-20261008/`, ignored

An original terminal fresh-headroom refusal after four complete/reproduced
checkpoints remains immutable. A disclosed operational protocol amendment filled
only the never-started fifth panel, under the **same original absolute 30-minute
cap**, frozen count/schedule and unchanged guards; no passed science repeated.
All science closed at986.16s from the original start; primary archival verification/

The source training checkpoints restore through the unchanged [PR197 model index](docs/reports/native-recovery-hu100-artifacts/followup-model-index.json).
Input retrieval checked #197's current merged state and its accepted local synced
ZIP whole/manifest/selected-member hashes; headers independently verify actual
completed nodes. No historical originals or archives were changed.

Restore to a fresh ignored nonsynced directory: download the indexed ZIP, run
`shasum -a 256 LOCAL_DOWNLOADED_PR200_ZIP` and require the whole hash above, then
`python3 -m zipfile -e LOCAL_DOWNLOADED_PR200_ZIP results/retrieved/pr200/NEW_ROOT`.
Decompress `ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json.gz`, verify both manifest hashes, then verify
needed member sizes/SHA256 before use. Exact source is
`research/exact-source/source-51597e8.tar`; extract it separately or check out that
pinned Git revision. Raw panel paths are
`research/hu100-learning-curves/run-01/{pilot,final,pilot-reproduction,final-reproduction}/{actual_nodes}/{opponent}/`.
Use the frozen original evaluator/auditor/reporting source, not an automatic
campaign relaunch. The immutable initial stop lives in `run-01/state.json`,
`run-01/guard/` and `run-01/closeout.json`; continuation has its own claims,
`continuation-guard/`, `continuation-complete.json` and `continuation-closeout.json`.
The exact standalone controller and review/qualification live under
`research/qualification/`. Full schedule, private streams, traces, pilot/final
stats and all source/qualification failures are retained. Originals remain and
no cleanup or synced-file eviction occurred. Later report/plots and independent
review/CI closeout are separate metadata; the primary science ZIP stays immutable.

verify each UTF-8 member's bytes/SHA256 before reconstructing it. Existing primary

checks; current GitHub checks are authoritative. No new science or merge.

## v0.4.2 published stable Latest — October 8, 2026

[Release PR #198](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/198), branch `feature/v042-release`; [readiness and publication sequence](docs/releases/v0.4.2/READINESS.md). The owner authorized the release PR, reviewed green-check merge, exact-source tag and stable Latest. No new research, retraining, extraction or selection. The historical #188 unpublished package below remains unchanged.

Input retrieval on M4 uses the already-synced [canonical #188 ZIP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ismlfD-LKQfFqAAR3O5LN_6UVmebHChH/view), `~/Local/Research-Cloud/PR-188-HU20-O-10B-LBR/hu20-v042-lbr-complete-20261008.zip`. Whole SHA256 `7a36e20f5e4560ec98d14ecaa4a6bb1fe77a7ecf1a5aa710cd1e03e586b45a80`, embedded `ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json` SHA256 `f5354027221c0750b086c3ff2553f6acdaded38b218a37963922f5e42544b702`. After confirming #188 merged, only the six `research/package/` members were copied into ignored nonsynced `~/Local/v042-release-20261008/source/results/v042-release/preparation/`, validating member sizes/SHA256 and the original standalone verifier against source `1d80bd02c2e8acf2dc99b75f6e0349bb55a941d8`. [Retrieval receipt](docs/releases/v0.4.2/verification/retrieval-receipt.json). Remote archive bytes were not downloaded; this is fresh local archive/member verification of the accepted canonical input.

To reproduce retrieval on M4, verify the indexed ZIP and embedded manifest hashes, then run `unzip -n "$ARCHIVE" 'research/package/*' 'ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json' -d results/retrieved/v042-release` in a fresh ignored directory and verify every selected member against that manifest. Run the extracted `verify_v042_bundle.py` with `--expect-source 1d80bd02c2e8acf2dc99b75f6e0349bb55a941d8`. Never use `research/package-attempt-01/`. Model member `research/package/O10B-HU20-opponent-sampled-average-seed-2026100601.jsonl.gz`, **249,237,403 bytes**, SHA256 `15736cc61a72baa1e6722b1566897917ffb6fdf8bea8874a82b5485fe95d4bae`.

The [M4 deterministic smoke](docs/releases/v0.4.2/verification/smoke-summary.json) and [resource/source receipts](docs/releases/v0.4.2/READINESS.md#verified-integration) pass. Release working files and runtime journals remain in the fresh M4 root above and ignored M1 `planning/v042-release/` / `results/v042-release/`. The final seven assets are published as stable Latest at [v0.4.2](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/releases/tag/v0.4.2), release ID 406532927, tagged source `a53f167fa736a481339034d1a7235202d599418c`. [Publication record, exact asset hashes and retrieval verification](docs/releases/v0.4.2/PUBLICATION.md). Publication manifest SHA256 `0257d1c3d724a0b3a81747a4868c1f236858b4fcc2c4d234797988daa618d82c` binds that exact source and preserves #188 preparation provenance. Fresh authenticated draft and unauthenticated public seven-file downloads independently verify on M4; the supported runtime loads the freshly published default and independently audits every smoke action/settlement. Latest and all older public asset URLs verify. Retrieve all seven files with `gh release download v0.4.2 --dir results/retrieved/v042-publication`, then on M4 run the downloaded `verify_v042_bundle.py` with `--expect-source a53f167fa736a481339034d1a7235202d599418c --require-publication`. Use a fresh ignored nonsynced directory. Raw receipts/journals remain in the indexed own release roots, including `merged-source/results/v042-release/public-download-01/` and `public-runtime-smoke-01/`; no heavy M4 release job remains. Existing v0.4.0/v0.4.1 release assets remain pinned and available. No evidence deletion, archive eviction, other PR root changes or post-publication cleanup is part of this task.

## PR196 — native HU100 engineering preparation, October 7, 2026

Preparation only: no campaign checkpoint/export, resource pilot, arena/benchmark,
large artifact download or research archive was produced. Transient deterministic
fixtures remain outside Git. Future campaigns require an owning PR and the
full Research-Cloud archive/member/upload/retrieval receipts below; there is no
new restoration link or deletion authorization from this preparation.

The [PR162 canonical archive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_6dRapLReZ9-sAMPaePNX-nehXowGwki/view)

Sample restoration passed. No remote-byte download, synced deletion, eviction or
unattended cleanup. Earlier retained-original statements are superseded only for
these exact receipted paths.

New entries follow the [shared storage and archive-receipt contract](docs/artifact-storage.md).
The [tracked-payload audit](docs/reports/necessary-cleaning.md) identifies retained Git evidence;
its retention list is not cloud verification or deletion approval.

## PR193 — local bot-vs-bot spectator validation

[Guide](docs/spectator.md), [compact verification](docs/reports/web-spectator-verification.json). All 25 retained spectator hands /141 decisions and 12 human hands independently replay through the pinned loaders; 102 focused tests pass. Reversed and same-model pairings, pause, step, reload and historical observations are checked. These are interface checks, not a strength comparison.

Retain the active worktree `/Users/dberweger/Local/deepcfr-web-spectator/` and its ignored `results/spectator-browser/` journals, screenshots, browser reports (including the interrupted first attempt), independent audits and the original `evidence-manifest.json` plus `integration-evidence-manifest.json`. The manifest records member sizes/SHA256, excluding the local access token and browser profiles. The owned server and isolated smoke browsers are stopped. No archival, upload acceptance or original removal is claimed; at requested cleanup, check the PR status and use `~/Local/Research-Cloud/PR-193-web-spectator/` within the [designated project folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/188bEt6i0RHqegCCdvpf3wPzUiRw78N2s).

Models in ignored `models/` are the existing release downloads: v0.4.0 `B100M-HU20-current-seed-2026093001.json.gz`, SHA256 `4534e7db2f69bedd54098b7eaa3c9bd82450838405ae162270a3b7684db9bedf`; v0.4.1 `O1B-HU20-opponent-sampled-average-seed-2026100601.jsonl.gz`, SHA256 `571e198266eabc6d8bb9de2d1aa76d9a68be0b2512222ea96874168989c6b74d`. Retrieve with the exact `gh release download` commands in the [readme](readme.md#install-and-play), then run the two model verifiers; the checked-in pinned manifests record their published release URLs and manifest hashes. No model binaries enter Git.

### Original preparation snapshot and archive provenance

[PR #185](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/185), [protocol](docs/hu20-o-10b.md), [dated preparation report](docs/reports/hu20-o-10b.md). Strength undecided: zero pilot/final poker hands. Separate unchanged 10B average/current native exports pass, but the full unchanged accumulator audit stops at 6.059 GiB; allocator-only retry also stops at 6.072 GiB. Both retain the 6-GiB guard; all failures are archived, no audit waived. 1B/2B/5B full audits pass. Conditional confirmation and v0.4.2 package are not triggered.

Upload acceptance for this new milestone is not yet claimed. Training continues to 10B, then seed 603.

Archive helper 74478 seals each subsequent atomic checkpoint and stable training tail for this authorized run only, then exits; future completion/upload is not claimed by this entry. Look up `<seed>/status.json`, `milestone-<nodes>.json`, `finished.json` under the active M4 `training/` root; archive/member receipts are retained beside each eventual ZIP. First-seed 10B is already canonical under #182. PR stays open; retain this active root, inputs, all originals and synced archives. No #166 touch, deletion, eviction or scheduled future research. Closeout documents/PR/CI/upload receipts are sealed separately in the same folder.

## M4 uploaded-original cleanup — October 6 evening

Merged **#166/#181** eligible originals and nonsynced archive copies removed after current Drive upload acceptance, full archive/member SHA256 and open-PR dependency checks: **6,025 paths /13.779 GB logical**, **12.198 GB measured free-space gain**, **30.173 GB free immediately after cleanup**. Open **#185/#186** roots/dependencies, shared Git, sources, prepared inputs, credentials, synced archives and unarchived evidence remain. PR181 closeout/publication originals lacking an exact M4 transfer map remain; only mapped preparation copies were removed.

[Cleanup and restoration](docs/artifacts/m4-uploaded-original-cleanup-20261006-evening.md), [compact verification](docs/artifacts/m4-uploaded-original-cleanup-20261006-evening.json), [full per-path receipt/restore helper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k6fw_iM91tvTfGCgocbADpt-L0Cx8dF3/view) (**2,576,866 bytes**, SHA256 `125a71d61c6f19324e1b9d1f03bf4b72e974f2f38860256f1d18662621659ed3`). Each removed path records canonical Drive ID/URL, archive hash, exact member/hash/size and restoration command. Retrieve the receipt ZIP into an ignored nonsynced directory and run its `restore.py --original ORIGINAL_ABSOLUTE_PATH --out results/retrieved/NEW_FILE`; it checks archive/member hashes. Historical retention claims are superseded only for the receipted paths. M1 originals remain. No unattended cleanup.

## PR182 — O learning curve

**Later merged-original cleanup:** after checking #182 MERGED, fresh native/cloud upload acceptance, every archive/member/original SHA256 and current dependencies, removed **23 M4 originals /3,020,460,782 logical bytes (2.81 GiB)**. [Exact removed paths, Drive URLs, archive members/hashes and restoration receipt](docs/reports/hu20-o-10b-artifacts/merged-pr182-cleanup-receipt.json), [fresh cloud metadata](docs/reports/hu20-o-10b-artifacts/merged-pr182-cloud-check.json). Canonical archives remain unchanged. Source/shared Git, plotting environment and metadata retained; #185 has verified copies of all required inputs, and all open roots including #166/#185/#186 stay protected. This supersedes earlier original-retention snapshots only. No synced deletion or eviction. Restore an individual file by downloading its receipt-pinned archive, verifying its whole SHA256, extracting the exact recorded member into a fresh ignored directory and checking the recorded member SHA256.

[PR #182](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/182), [report and chart](docs/reports/hu20-learning-curve.md), [predeclared protocol](docs/hu20-learning-curve.md).

## Verified local-copy cleanup — October 6, 2026

Owner-authorized merged-run cleanup removed 2,134 verified files on M1 and 1,572 on M4. Measured removal-batch reclamation: **27.88 GB M1 / 19.04 GB M4**; final free space **57.23 GB / 38.64 GB**. Streamed archive verification populated native cache while #182 training continued, so these are distinct measurements.

[Cleanup and retrieval guide](docs/artifacts/merged-research-original-cleanup-20261006.md) · [full path/member/SHA256 receipts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P_KUWSE-gM2SwMCCvkn6TFONBslc6qz7/view?usp=drivesdk). All six canonical archives have fresh whole-archive/member checks, native upload acceptance and matching current Drive metadata. The receipt maps every removed path to its Drive ID, archive SHA256, member, source SHA256 and retrieval command. Open #166/#182 roots, #165 original inputs/provenance, #175 historical policies, source/shared Git, changed or unarchived files and synced archives remain. Earlier retention statements are historical; this cleanup receipt records later removals. No unattended task or cache eviction.

## PR181 — v0.4.1 release preparation

[Release PR #181](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/181), [comparison/report/chart](docs/reports/v0.4.1-release.md), [readiness, screenshots and verification](docs/releases/v0.4.1/READINESS.md), [cleanup inventory](docs/releases/v0.4.1/CLEANUP.md). #176 and #179 are merged; #180's model-storage guidance is preserved. The owner selected the exact #165 first-seed O average. The owner-approved v0.4.1 default retains shipped v0.4.0 selection. All **10 real web hands / 83 actions / 37 bot distributions** independently verify, including both seats and exact 201-chip free sizing. No missing/zero-mass/unexpected fallback appears in these hands. All 92 captured final-run API responses are HTTP 200, with no browser/server errors in that checked interval. All five unpublished assets verify after a staged HTTP download from a clean checkout. **The owner gave the final chat go; [v0.4.1 release assets](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/releases/tag/v0.4.1) bind the exact O1 model to the merged source. v0.4.0 remains available.**

The **40 retrieved M4 files all match source size/SHA256**, excluding the live access credential, which is retained locally but never archived or published. Public sanitized receipts are under `docs/releases/v0.4.1/verification/`; private SQLite journals/recorded positions remain in the research archive.

## PR179 — HU20 zero-mass current fallback

[PR #179](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/179), [full report](docs/reports/hu20-zero-mass-fallback.md), [frozen protocol](docs/hu20-zero-mass-fallback.md). Merged #178’s optional current-policy export fallback shows **no detectable difference** against either original: T′−T **+0.18 [−2.19, +2.56]**, O′−O **−0.35 [−2.71, +2.02] BB/100**. Secondary T′−R1 **+5.46 [2.47, 8.46]** and O′−R1 **+6.48 [3.48, 9.48]** are better; T′−O **−0.99 [−3.36, 1.39]** is no detectable difference. All lineages are reported. Neither primary is better, so the conditional pressure check is not triggered. No release decision.

M1-only originals: `~/Local/hu20-zero-mass-fallback-20261006/`. Execution source `9a24fe6b43088026e14227934ec6599e017646bf`; merged native source `0a3765f34335b8ca8efea7d79e25c7fd19d94657`. Exact six checkpoints and original T/O/R1 policies match #165’s manifest. All six fresh exports (23,042,805 keys) pass full accumulator/current-policy audits. Final root `202610063501`, excluded pilot `202610063401`; five families ×36,864 paired deal blocks ×three lineages ×two seats = **1,105,920 final hands / 5,721,474 actions**. All final and **61,440 pilot hands / 318,419 actions** independently replay. Canonical final plan SHA256 `1c379fec6390931a8d5f88dbf9c0390d552ef4fa6c2f4575748dfdbfd740bd18`. All primary half-widths are **2.37–3.40**, meeting ≤4. Free compute only, no M4 jobs or RunPod, at most three workers, 6-GiB RSS guard and 8-GiB disk floor; no guard failure or deletion.

The ZIP stores gzip members without redundant compression: exact checkpoint/policy inputs, all research outputs, frozen source/binary/environment, plans, raw pilot/final action/settlement traces, logs, preparation attempts, audits, protocol/comments and `RESTORE-README.md.gz`. Use the verified `source-9a24fe6-complete-verified.tar.gz`; earlier attempts are preserved losslessly with correction receipts. [Archive receipt](docs/reports/hu20-zero-mass-fallback-artifacts/archive-receipt.json.gz) records identity and retained originals. Later publication/CI/final docs are sealed in a separate member-hashed closeout ZIP in the same folder. Local ZIP/member readback is verified; remote cloud byte readback is not claimed. Never delete or evict synced files.

## PR174 Luna versus Shield — October 6, 2026

PR174 evidence remains locally retained; no archival or cleanup has been performed. The active M1 root `/Users/dberweger/Local/luna-shield-chrome/results/luna-shield-20261006/` retains isolated preflight evidence, the primary private SQLite/access token, server/resource logs, run receipt, actual final HTTP export/history, strict-reporter rejection, raw audit and native evidence builder. The independently launched player's original rollout remains in `/Users/dberweger/.codex/sessions/2026/10/06/`, session `01a11070-fb6b-7961-a30b-e904731fd0af`; do not publish its reasoning or unfiltered contents. The [sanitized report](docs/reports/luna-shield-chrome.md) records 400 replayed hands and Luna −82 BB, with the failed browser protocol and missing planned metadata retained. The [manifest](docs/reports/luna-shield-chrome/manifest.json) identifies public evidence and hashes private inputs without publishing them.

The policy hardlink at `luna-shield-chrome/models/O-2026100601.average.jsonl.gz` depends on #171's retained original `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-cfr-plus-pr171-20261006/policies/O-2026100601.average.jsonl.gz`. The active PR174 root and retained PR171 input dependencies remain protected. No archival, moving or cleanup was performed. Eventual cleanup destination: `PR-174-Luna-Shield/20261006/` under the [project research folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/188bEt6i0RHqegCCdvpf3wPzUiRw78N2s), with private access controls for journals and transcripts, manifests and restoration provenance.

## PR175 — HU20 CFR+ floor control

[PR #175](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/175), [full report](docs/reports/hu20-floor-control.md), [frozen protocol](docs/hu20-floor-control.md). Primary T−R1 **+8.12 [5.50, 10.73]**; direct shield−T **−14.26 [−16.90, −11.62]**; secondary O−R1 **+11.45 [8.83, 14.07] BB/100**. Every lineage matches its aggregate label. All 884,736 final plus 36,864 pilot hands and 4,581,025 actions independently replay, with raw-chip interval/label agreement. All primary half-widths are ≤4. Free M4 only, 10.46 minutes through final admission/play/report/audit. No training or release decision.

Research originals: M4 `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-floor-control-pr175-20261006/`, verified M1 retrieval `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-floor-control-20261006/`. Execution source `8bbfc457` (unchanged #173 direct tools); final root `202610061601`, excluded pilot `202610061501`; each family has 49,152 duplicate deal blocks. Canonical bundled plan SHA256 `7e1cf06d29b2988faf9c262f7c81bdf7c12c4c5e2b59c4da702046e9d4779036`. All ten exact input exports and all 18 retrieved raw traces match their manifest/auditor hashes.

Archive: `~/Local/Research-Cloud/PR-175-HU20-floor-control/hu20-floor-control-complete-20261006.zip`. The embedded `ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json` pins every research member by size/SHA256, with every member verified by ZIP readback. It preserves input manifests and exact policy files, complete source, environment/native binary, pilot/final plans, raw actions/settlements, reports/audits, logs, preparation failures and `RESTORE-README.md`. The separate `archive-receipt.json` beside it records ZIP size/SHA256, manifest hash and verified member count; subsequent publication/upload receipts are closeout metadata. Restore into a fresh nonsynced folder, verify all members, extract `source-8bbfc457.tar`, and follow the archived independent-replay commands. Originals remain on both Macs; no synced file is deleted or evicted. Native upload status is recorded separately; no independent cloud byte readback is claimed.

Verified main ZIP: **147 members / 2,100,003,481 logical bytes**, ZIP **2,018,260,354 bytes**. SHA256 `f350afc81cb8090d24ca125413df8d58259e1d1787912193d13de291904a6962`; embedded manifest SHA256 `d7a4aaa73f704bdd586f32bb969d10bc88887a31647918c383e66435724af16f`. All members pass readback. Final publication/validation/upload receipts and updated report metadata are retained in a separate member-hashed closeout ZIP in the same folder.

## PR171 CFR+ / 0.4.0-shield — October 6, 2026 (audited failed release candidate)

[Implementation #171](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/171) merged at `60f516da6b24563a49e609636a31fa17ae719bde`. [Research #173](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/173), [frozen protocol](docs/hu20-cfr-plus-confirmation.md), [owner review packet](docs/reports/hu20-cfr-plus.md) and [complete diagnostics](docs/reports/hu20-cfr-plus-details.md). Three 1B-node lineages, nine 100M/500M/1B checkpoints and six native current/traverser-reach-average exports pass the floor-zero labels, complete-header, nonnegative-regret and source-hash checks. [Checkpoint/export manifest](docs/reports/hu20-cfr-plus-artifacts/checkpoints-manifest.json).

The frozen rule is not met: LBR +36.13 [17.55, 54.70], native pressure −22.82 [−31.83, −13.80] BB/100. New direct primary against shipped R1: **−8.61 [−11.69, −5.53] BB/100, worse**, all three candidate lineages individually worse; all nine secondary pairings retained. The scoped full-export turn/river comparison uses the identical pipeline and all 40 boards: E 2.715 [2.492, 2.932] → 0.916 [0.863, 0.970] BB; Q 2.679 [2.325, 3.058] → 0.326 [0.287, 0.363]. No release recommendation. **After reviewing the direct confirmation loss, the owner declined rc1 for this candidate. No release, tag or pre-release; v0.4.0 stays stable.**

Owned root on both Macs: `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-cfr-plus-pr171-20261006/`.

Total arena/direct confirmation and retained exploratory evidence: **1,370,112 hands / 6,612,090 actions** independently replayed. M4 transfer: **715 files / 9,486,820,764 bytes**, every source and retrieved SHA256 matches; both hosts' originals remain. Native-pressure descriptive partitions reconcile exactly to the frozen contrast; no translator and zero off-menu native-pressure bet sizes. Labels and the final sample were declared before scores; no outcome-driven extension.

The owner gives the tested CFR+ production averages the **friendly model name 0.4.0-shield**, short **0.4.0-s**, for future checks. It is not a software release version or Git tag. [Model identity](docs/reports/hu20-cfr-plus-artifacts/shield-model-identity.json) pins all three seeds and export SHA256s. The name refers to lower measured weakness on the tested probes; it does not claim lower full-game exploitability. The direct confirmation remains worse.

All 165,888 hands / 850,106 actions replay; every aggregate absolute estimate and all 52 contrasts independently match raw-chip arithmetic. No follow-up arena, release, tag or deletion.

Original campaign: M1 `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-native-average-20261005/` and M4 `~/Local/hu20-native-average-20261005/`, with frozen M1 runtime checkout `.claude/worktrees/deepcfr-repo-access-830ea6` and M4 `repo`. Runtime source `376763af4f52a5829f7aac463750e3c501c20cff`; canonical plan SHA256 `5d096197840097b93e56aca3ccbb480ac3335e9ef546c7faac358233ac18626f`, file SHA256 `3b98e9c467371b653a47d2ed4b7348525669a4ce0cc085a49d7779fe481ac053`. Both done markers and all twelve complete model results pass. M4's eight raw/result files are copied into M1's `arena/run/` with exact size/SHA256 [transfer proof](docs/reports/hu20-v041-arena-artifacts/m4-run-transfer.json); all twelve policy hashes pass on both hosts and all six checkpoint hashes match export provenance. M4's original files remain in place.

Both whole archives are **accepted uploaded** in [PR-165-HU20-native-average](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IXMpL2f18EVb1FfoFTvAaOGIzdrRpeD2), through native Drive at `~/Local/Research-Cloud/PR-165-HU20-native-average/`. Native FileProvider reports uploaded=1, uploading=0, no unresolved conflict and exact document size; cloud metadata independently matches exact name/size/parent. [Upload receipt](docs/reports/hu20-v041-arena-artifacts/drive-upload-confirmed.json) preserves IDs and archive hashes. Source files, archive members and staged archive SHA256s verify with zero mismatches; no cloud byte re-download is claimed.

Separate verified archives remain at M1 `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-v041-archives-20261005/`. The campaign archive preserves every training checkpoint/policy, pilot, timing, raw hand, tail, worker/launch log, frozen plan, merged reporter output and native binary under `M1-hu20-native-average-20261005/`. Manifest SHA256 `094953b982c8995dd3b4e17668850725d2696f42f72c169ac70eb8e74f831f3c`; [receipt](docs/reports/hu20-v041-arena-artifacts/campaign-archive.json), [member manifest](docs/reports/hu20-v041-arena-artifacts/campaign-archive-manifest.json).

The closeout snapshot preserves the exact independent audit/renderer/archival scripts, full-precision audit, logs, environment, both hosts' policy hash checks, M4 metadata/launch logs, transfer receipts, owner closeout instruction, report drafts and a complete frozen Git source archive under `M1-closeout/`. Manifest SHA256 `a7d61294d4a9f20827d9f79f811258395af51151be590d44a5b66442f2a5cdda`; [receipt](docs/reports/hu20-v041-arena-artifacts/closeout-archive.json), [member manifest](docs/reports/hu20-v041-arena-artifacts/closeout-archive-manifest.json). This snapshot precedes final upload/PR publication receipts; those compact supplements and final reports are retained beside the whole archives in Drive and in this PR.

Restore each archive into a fresh local directory with `tar -xzf <archive> -C <fresh-directory>`; verify every extracted `ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json` member SHA256 before analysis. The embedded `RESTORE-README.txt` maps directory prefixes to original paths. To reproduce the reporter, use the preserved source with `PYTHONPATH=. python -m scripts.evaluate_hu20_v041_arena report --plan <restored>/M1-hu20-native-average-20261005/arena/plan.json --out <restored>/M1-hu20-native-average-20261005/arena/run`. To reproduce the independent audit, run preserved `M1-closeout/audit.py --plan <same-plan> --run <same-run> --out <new-audit.json>` with that source on `PYTHONPATH`. All original campaign/checkpoint/policy inputs, retrieved records, source snapshot and separate local archives remain; no eviction or deletion is authorized by this closeout.

## PR162 HU20 trainer bench — October 5 closeout

[Report](docs/reports/hu20-trainer-bench.md): both folds completed 3M iterations and all 40 held-out roots scored the 12 frozen policies. Production/opponent-sampled Q=0.9514/0.7308 classifies a poor CFR fixed point in v1 under the unchanged rule. Runtime commit `74ba3202396128a3823b654d05d0b002b3c4ceed`; no native failure, resource breach or relaunch; $0 paid compute. [Independent bootstrap verification](docs/reports/hu20-trainer-bench-artifacts/independent-summary-verification.json) reproduces every E/Q estimate and interval, and [raw verification](docs/reports/hu20-trainer-bench-artifacts/RAW-VERIFICATION.json) checks every native metric, paired #149 reference and request/response/policy hash.

M4 originals remain at `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-trainer-bench-20261005/`. Whole verified archive: `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-trainer-bench-closeout-20261005/hu20-trainer-bench-m4-complete-20261005.tar.gz`, **1,745,796,815 bytes**, SHA256 `67d51196af43202d6e2ebff5222ccfd6a264c1d9d0eb4efdc7ccfa1fa78d3dd3`. The archive verifies **2,809 file members / 5,663,368,615 logical bytes**; manifest SHA256 `62aefd4d8b9dc3e4380612f772d513384c2049e6fc708d3bba1334230cf0a049`. It preserves smoke evidence, all checkpoints and recovery states, every raw native result/log/request, frozen source, the selected lineage's #149 inputs/references, monitoring snapshots/comments and the first archival path-error attempt. Git administration and reproducible caches/environments are excluded; full upstream #149 source and other lineages remain in the separately indexed complete PR149 archive. [Archive receipt](docs/reports/hu20-trainer-bench-artifacts/ARCHIVE-RECEIPT.json).

A separate hash-verified copy is staged through M4 native Drive desktop at `~/Local/Research-Cloud/PR-162-HU20-trainer-bench/M4-run-20261005/` in the [designated research folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/188bEt6i0RHqegCCdvpf3wPzUiRw78N2s), with `ARCHIVE-MANIFEST-20261005.json`, `ARCHIVE-RECEIPT.json`, `PROVENANCE.json`, `RAW-VERIFICATION.json` and `RESTORE-README.txt`. [Staging receipt](docs/reports/hu20-trainer-bench-artifacts/drive-staging.json): staged bytes match, M4 free disk 24.89 GiB, **cloud upload was originally unconfirmed; October 5 native acceptance, current cloud name/size/parent and staged SHA256 checks now confirm the archive**. No original or synced payload was deleted or evicted. The retained failed staging directory is `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-trainer-bench-closeout-20261005.partial-1791202039/`.

Restore the whole archive into a fresh directory, verify its SHA256 and every manifest member, and use `PROVENANCE.json` plus `RESTORE-README.txt` to rebind absolute input paths only in a restored working copy. The `hu20-trainer-bench-20261005/` prefix maps to the original M4 work root; `inputs/` contains copied immutable dependencies and archival/monitoring provenance. M1 reporter input/verification and the separate compressed retrieval are retained at `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-trainer-bench-monitor-20261005/`; the [M1 retrieval receipt](docs/reports/hu20-trainer-bench-artifacts/retrieval.json) verifies the full archive SHA256 and all 2,809 file members with zero mismatches.

## PR163 full-deck equity buckets — October 5 closeout

M4 originals: `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-equity-buckets-20261005/`. Frozen builder commit `4ade72cc18e512ed9f11fa6afa83c701a55069c8`; all six `{flop,turn,river}-k{50,200}.bin` tables, `summary.json`, original `SHA256SUMS`, status/host/test/memory files and complete `build.log` are retained. All 16 original files / **2,768,097,096 bytes** independently SHA256-verified on M4 before rental termination; the builder's ten manifest entries pass. `verification/` retains the exact reader, sanity/retrieval scripts and receipts, supplemental full-file hashes and complete pod MCP responses. [Report and pending validation plan](docs/reports/hu20-equity-buckets.md), [retrieval](docs/reports/hu20-equity-buckets-artifacts/retrieval.json), [sanity](docs/reports/hu20-equity-buckets-artifacts/sanity.json), [termination](docs/reports/hu20-equity-buckets-artifacts/termination.json).

Whole archive: M4 `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-equity-buckets-closeout-20261005/hu20-equity-buckets-20261005.tar.gz`, **1,991,949,530 bytes**, SHA256 `03d4828f030082f213c8ce82e29fa0fa8fd97288bd8035ad0056de85bc0816ca`. All **29 source members / 2,768,143,080 logical bytes**, archive members and retained originals match; manifest SHA256 `a5d64a7882da34840dad53905e4a03284f822487732ce691ecc82cdf1585bdef`. Restore by extracting the archive into a fresh directory, then verify every `ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json` member plus the original `SHA256SUMS`; `RESTORE-README.txt` records the directory prefix.

A separate APFS copy is hash-verified and staged through native Drive desktop at `~/Local/Research-Cloud/PR-163-equity-buckets/hu20-equity-buckets-20261005.tar.gz` in [the PR163 archive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gwungsUq-b9uey8InGy0yOD2GbaMRhp-). Manifest, restore README and [staging receipt](docs/reports/hu20-equity-buckets-artifacts/drive-staging.json) accompany it. **Upload was originally unconfirmed; October 5 native acceptance, current cloud name/size/parent and staged SHA256 checks now confirm the archive.** Original table folder and separate local archive remain; no deletion or forced cache eviction occurred. M4 free space after staging: **32.505 GiB**, above 20 GiB. These tables are active inputs for validation proposed on #163, awaiting explicit owner approval. Pod `90gceq0t9mqz6q` is gone; the four older exited pods are unchanged. Estimated compute $0.148889. No table files enter Git; no validation, training, new rental or merge has run.

## October 4 organization and native Drive uploads

[Canonical repository index](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/blob/main/RESULTS_INDEX.md). Repository-relative report links below resolve there; the Drive folder links work independently.

This is the existing research index. Its September inventory and October 2 receipts remain below; the current locations and upload states in this section supersede those earlier snapshots.

Both Macs use Google Drive desktop in streaming mode, with `~/Local/Research-Cloud` pointing to the same [research folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/188bEt6i0RHqegCCdvpf3wPzUiRw78N2s). Those historical Mac uploads went through the desktop app. The owner's October 16 cache policy at the top of this index supersedes that route for new work; Macs are now read-only. The connector's observed 536,870,912-byte ingestion ceiling does not apply to this route; no research payload was split for the native uploads.

- **Organization verified:** 207 existing entries moved into [Historical-experiments](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AIsc7LBHc7ziwrpOuwMuCPnvZpCJS1Zr), and five cleanup records into [Archive-receipts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10cG2BTBZLcE7lO10TgBZ0Ud32quaf_BX). IDs and existing links are preserved. The [relocation receipt](docs/artifacts/native-drive-relocations-20261004.json) records every original parent, destination and verified item ID.
- **M4 upload queue:** nine closed scopes, **28,756 files / 96,459,366,205 logical bytes (89.83 GiB)**, hashed before relocation into the streamed folder. Includes closed training and flop/turn evidence. Local payloads remain under Drive management while uploading.
- **M1 upload queue:** four closed scopes, **24,637 files / 37,983,420,181 logical bytes (35.37 GiB)**, likewise hashed and staged. The first attempt stopped before moving any file because newly created cloud folders had not appeared locally; after those folders synchronized, staging completed. The failed attempt is retained.
- **PR136 upload queue:** the intact `hu20-500m-campaign-20261001-archive-20261002.tar.gz`, **23,509,934,825 bytes**, is uploading from M1. SHA256: `c0dbb3879eeae5f89be888ca3b29a6c571f6adb214c9d23c6095d0cab007636d`. The separate M4 originals remain until upload confirmation.
- **Already confirmed:** the 14,041,643,443-byte branching archive, the overnight archive, PR144's six archives and 18 earlier M4 archives. Their previous cloud IDs remain valid; the branching archive now lives under `Historical-experiments/`.
- **Pending means pending:** native staging is not cloud-upload confirmation. An hourly archival follow-up checks completion and remaining duplicate/input dependencies. The [compact staging receipt](docs/artifacts/native-drive-staging-20261004.json) records exact source paths, destination paths, counts and manifest names. Logical totals include separately retained evidence and do not measure unique or physical disk use.

### October 4 scheduled follow-up and cleanup

The index/organization change passed all CI and merged in [PR #151](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/151). The [cleanup progress receipt](docs/artifacts/drive-cleanup-progress-20261004.json) records the following subsequent actions:

- **M1:** removed 26 abandoned, unindexed Git temporary packs (6,362,104,120 bytes), 12 separately retained staging archives with fresh cloud ID/name/size readback and matching archive SHA256 (3,522,030,679 bytes), and four obsolete connector parts (2,097,152,000 bytes). The parts matched the corresponding bytes of the intact recovered archive. Total removed logical bytes: **11,981,286,799 (11.16 GiB)**. Valid Git packs/indexes and readable HEAD trees remain intact. Physical free-space changes also depend on APFS sharing and ongoing Drive cache activity.
- **M4:** removed **1,826 files / 6,418,060,050 bytes** from separately retained, cloud-confirmed legacy archive roots after checking each member hash, current stat identity, tracked files, symlink/input dependencies and open handles. The complete per-file restore receipt remains `~/Local/research-archive-preparation-20261002/m4-remaining-duplicate-cleanup-20261004.json`; original relative member paths and cloud archive IDs are retained. M4 had **42.54 GiB free** after this cleanup. No synced Drive payload was deleted.
- **PR136 upload incident:** Drive logs record a completed CancelUpload at `2026-10-04T08:24:40Z`; the initiating actor is unknown. The file was absent from the upload folder/cloud listing but retained intact in Drive desktop's `canceled_uploads` recovery directory. Its full 23,509,934,825 bytes rehashed to the original SHA256 above. It was moved back into the native upload folder at about `09:35 UTC`, without rebuilding research or making another archive. **Upload remains pending**, and M4 originals remain retained. The recovery receipt is included in the compact progress record; do not confuse queueing with cloud completion.

Native upload queues are still processing. The hourly follow-up remains active; no cache eviction, new science or rental was performed.

### Later October 4 cleanup

[PR #152](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/152) passed all checks and merged. Ten older blueprint experiment folders now use their existing `Historical-experiments/` cloud folders through links at the original M1 paths. Removed **149 separate local duplicate files / 3,547,485,700 logical bytes (3.30 GiB)** after exact cloud relative-name/size readback, unchanged September inventory checks, source hashes, tracked-file checks and open-handle checks. `blueprint-04-ops` code remains local. Full per-file cloud IDs/hashes are retained in Drive `Archive-receipts/M1-blueprint-duplicate-cleanup-20261004.json`; the [compact cleanup receipt](docs/artifacts/blueprint-drive-cleanup-20261004.json) records every affected scope. No synced payload was removed.

The first cleanup validation compared access time, which changed during its own hash read; it stopped before any payload change. Its receipt/helper were retained, and the corrected check uses size, modification time, inode and device. All subsequent removals completed.

At the hourly check M4 had **46.67 GiB free**. M1 had **16.36 GiB free** after cleanup while Drive was still filling its streaming cache; removed logical bytes do not promise equal physical reclamation. Both native upload queues are progressing, and PR136 remains pending with M4 originals retained. Hourly chat updates continue.

### Whole archives by PR and run — owner-approved update

The owner subsequently approved converting the pending small-file batches to **one whole `.tar.gz` per distinct run inside its existing PR/experiment folder**. This supersedes the earlier preference limited to unstaged experiments. The [archive transition receipt](docs/artifacts/run-archive-bundling-20261004.json) lists every planned archive and its original source.

- **M4:** 37 run/experiment archives are building. All nine sources passed membership/link/open-handle checks before relocation to `~/Local/research-native-originals-m4-20261004/`; old working paths point there. Their loose upload folders were withdrawn, with every original payload retained. Whole archives enter the unchanged PR parent folders only after source hashes and every archived member verify.
- **M1:** 22 archives are building from the four existing native source folders in place. The first attempt to export a large native folder blocked and appeared to hydrate it; that worker was stopped before the first rename completed. Sources remain unchanged. The replacement avoids folder export and reads only the selected members.
- **Packaging incident retained:** after verifying 26 M4 archives, the helper rejected tarfile’s automatic hardlink metadata for an existing regular hard-linked file. The resumed helper disables automatic inode encoding, applies explicit content deduplication and the same full member hash checks, skips completed archives and retains the failed partial. No source was removed.
- **One shared calibration archive:** M1 `m4-calibration-03-complete` and M4 `calibration-03` have **17,850 identical relative names/sizes/hashes / 29,491,888,105 bytes**. Upload `M4-closed-research--calibration-03-20261004.tar.gz` once from M4; preserve both source locations until upload acceptance. No second archive is made on M1. For M1 restoration, extract `M4-closed-research/calibration-03/` and point the old `m4-calibration-03-complete` run path at it; names below that prefix and all member hashes are identical.
- **Restoration:** each archive includes `ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json` and `RESTORE-README.txt`. Extract with `tar -xzf ARCHIVE.tar.gz` into a fresh local directory, then verify member SHA256 entries. Exact duplicate contents inside an archive may use standard tar hardlinks, preserving all relative paths; treat restored evidence as read-only. Private credentials remain outside the archives.

Building or queueing an archive is **not upload confirmation**. M4 originals remain separately retained; M1 originals remain in their existing native folders pending archive acceptance and later safe reconciliation. Existing confirmed historical archives and PR136's whole upload are unchanged. Free-space guards reserve 8 GiB, and no cache is forcibly evicted. Hourly chat updates continue. [PR #153](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/153) passed all checks and merged before this update.

### October 4 12:30 UTC follow-up

[PR #154](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/154) passed all checks and merged. The [hourly progress receipt](docs/artifacts/drive-archive-progress-20261004-1230.json) distinguishes packaged files, exact cloud name/size matches and accepted native completion.

- **M1:** all **22 run archives / 1,687,920,071 compressed bytes** are built and every source/member hash verified. Originals remain in place. The earlier read stopped when FileProvider changed one timestamp by 30 ns; content SHA256, size and inode stayed identical. A retained incident proves the exact double-seconds-to-timespec conversion. The new helper permits only that exact timestamp transformation after content validation; other identity changes still stop it. The failed partial is retained. No scientific work reran.
- **M4:** **36/37 archives / 29,743,314,324 compressed bytes** are built. The last `day-paper-16k-2026091902` run waits for sufficient free disk, retaining its originals. The prepared resume helper has not launched. A separate **427,324,620-byte PR145 six-input archive** finished with all six member hashes verified; it is queued in the existing PR145 folder, with originals retained.
- **PR136:** the full **23,509,934,825-byte** archive is now visible in the correct cloud folder as [this exact item](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19mPzvR0fF1vHzr-cRMsueTlHiQtthOcB/view). Its local native item ID matches. The app still reports one pending file, and explicit native completion for this archive is unconfirmed; separate M4 originals remain protected.
- **Storage:** approximately **11–12 GiB free per Mac** during this check while native uploads/cache continue. No originals were removed. Accepted upload cleanup will provide headroom; no forced eviction or chunking is used. Hourly updates continue.

### Accepted uploads and safe cleanup — October 4 owner-requested check

This confirmation supersedes the pending states in the historical snapshots above. [PR #155](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/155) passed all checks and merged. The [accepted-upload receipt](docs/artifacts/drive-upload-confirmed-20261004.json) records every current archive ID, name, size, source hash and restore prefix.

- **All 22 M1 run archives accepted:** 1,687,920,071 compressed bytes; native desktop reports Up to date/Synced and the current cloud names/sizes match every verified archive.
- **All 38 M4 archives accepted:** the 37 run archives plus the separate six-file PR145 input archive, totaling 38,268,264,296 compressed bytes. Read-only native FileProvider metadata reports `isUploaded=1`, `isUploading=0`, no unresolved conflict and the exact document size for each item. Native item IDs match the cloud IDs and exact names/sizes. No cloud re-download was required.
- **PR136 accepted:** the intact 23,509,934,825-byte archive is [confirmed uploaded](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19mPzvR0fF1vHzr-cRMsueTlHiQtthOcB/view). Its earlier cancellation/recovery and all failed attempts remain documented. The separate M4 originals were removed only after upload acceptance and per-member/dependency checks: 1,218 files / 23,524,835,844 logical bytes.
- **M4 run originals cleaned:** 28,758 separate local files / 96,886,556,351 logical bytes removed after member SHA256, unchanged stat, tracked-file, symlink-dependency and open-handle checks. The 38 archive IDs and original paths remain in restore stubs and the [full removal journal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PE25ZTR-0fYepxNRn5rauhEWa16W0KOd/view). Keys, coding source, valid Git/environment data and cloud payloads were preserved.
- **M1 canceled duplicates cleaned:** five abandoned copies outside the synced folder, 84,502,367,174 logical bytes, matched already accepted PR136/branching/overnight archives by exact SHA256 and identity. Their receipts and restoration links are retained in [Archive-receipts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10cG2BTBZLcE7lO10TgBZ0Ud32quaf_BX).
- **Measured physical free storage after cleanup:** M4 **106,754,224,128 bytes (99.42 GiB)**; M1 **52,697,604,096 bytes (49.08 GiB)**. Logical removed bytes can share APFS blocks, so these figures are actual filesystem measurements rather than a subtraction estimate.
- **Remaining work:** inventory smaller closed evidence outside this batch, preserve current input dependencies until restore mappings are established, and reconcile the four M1 native raw-backup folders with their accepted canonical archives. These managed cloud folders remain intact; no synced data was deleted to free cache. Hourly follow-up and chat updates continue.

### Remaining evidence and raw-backup organization — October 4 13:37 UTC follow-up

[PR #156](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/156) passed scope/full0/full1/test/GitGuardian and merged. The [remaining-evidence receipt](docs/artifacts/drive-remaining-evidence-20261004.json) records this follow-up.

The four redundant M1 raw folders now live under `Historical-experiments/`, named `PR148--M1-closed-research--raw-backup-20261004`, `PR148--M1-exact-turn-evidence--raw-backup-20261004`, `M1-board-pooling--closed-evidence--raw-backup-20261004` and `M1-alias-audit--closed-evidence--raw-backup-20261004`. IDs, sharing and contents were preserved. Cloud parent/name readback and native folder IDs verified all four moves; original working aliases now point to the new native locations. Canonical whole archives remain in their PR folders. No raw cloud payload was deleted or large folder exported. [Organization receipt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uIf5ZCn61A3WCXeLd9eNbcqHFzIowr5d/view).

- **PR129 parity evidence:** a verified whole archive of 91 members / 173,805,058 source bytes from the M1 platform pilot and RunPod retrieval, `PR129-platform-parity-20261004.tar.gz`, is [confirmed uploaded](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1utMZPG-zV4lMIwgI7ouw0l2EJyyjOoKC/view) in [PR-129-platform-parity](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SHrAg6PQV5wdG-tV3-WEu9AeO5eil5ft). Compressed size 149,683,235 bytes; SHA256 `95f1099b2587d6002b32e08ac7aed8c67c0b1e90b93588a8f4ce4e5289580023`. Native uploaded/not-uploading/no-conflict/exact-size status and current cloud name/size confirm acceptance. Both original sources remain intact pending dependency-aware cleanup.
- **PR145 earlier retrieval snapshots:** the M1 retrieval snapshot contains 819 result files / 2,469,278,300 bytes without matching content in the newer accepted M4 result archive, spanning earlier flop and turn attempts. They remain protected. The complete intact flop run is now verified in a separate whole `PR145-flop-retained-attempts-20261004.tar.gz` (501 members / 565,822,969 source bytes; 18,600,998 compressed bytes; SHA256 `500b269afce4799d313a9c49788b367f4f49e310a8a04723ba7cc609a6b3dff6`) and queued in the existing PR145 folder; upload acceptance is pending. A separate verified `PR145-turn-retrieval-snapshot-20261004.tar.gz` preserves the earlier turn run (507 members / 1,919,529,239 source bytes; 108,091,354 compressed bytes; SHA256 `8dd3d8621d8628a1a04e01947c0abdaf3eeb136bb6c332ce4c3209b7e0374422`) and is queued with originals retained. The other 193 result files / 16,075,493 bytes match accepted archive members but also remain retained during complete restoration/dependency mapping. Tool/source, local retrieval metadata and six input files remain protected. The first shell background launch ended before its initial status or any archive/source change; the incident is retained and the detached packaging launcher succeeded.
- **Other-owner evidence and coordination incident:** PR149 had separately resumed on October 4. Its preparation stopped when archival removed the unopened third-lineage export from the shared M4 input directory. Open-handle and narrow process checks missed a future input declared in the active plan; the earlier owner statement that all science was closed was stale. Eighty board exports completed, but qualification/native solver/main jobs never started. The owning task restored all three exact average exports from the retained M1 copies into isolated M4 inputs and verified the hashes on both hosts. No file was lost and no scientific restart was performed by archival. The [incident/restoration record](docs/artifacts/shared-input-archival-incident-20261004.json) is preserved. Protect PR149 preparation, both dated retrieval folders and its declared inputs through the owning task's verified closeout. Before any further original cleanup, check active task manifests/approval/continuation state for every declared input, including files without open handles. Coding fixtures, private keys and valid Git/environments remain available.

Hourly checks continue upload acceptance, remaining inventory, restore mapping and safe separate-original cleanup. These pending archives do not change the accepted state of the earlier 22 M1 / 38 M4 / PR136 batch.

### Retrieval copies accepted and cleaned — October 4 14:37 UTC follow-up

[PR #157](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/157) passed all required checks with no findings and merged. The [retrieval cleanup receipt](docs/artifacts/drive-retrieval-cleanup-20261004.json) supersedes the pending states above.

- **PR145 snapshots accepted:** [retained flop attempts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jEmvLPJsmnjmh-zZSrVevA0ura17dGlK/view), 18,600,998 bytes, and [earlier turn retrieval](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GNyipWYxTImoXI9gJpkIzMSbCeBngEOk/view), 108,091,354 bytes. Both have native uploaded/not-uploading/no-conflict/exact-size proof and current cloud name/size/parent readback. Their member manifests, SHA256 and restoration prefixes remain embedded.
- **Retrieval provenance accepted:** [whole metadata bundle](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z1JnP3CrveLDfVpTUsxxe-WAXBZPoJbk/view), 146,598 bytes, SHA256 `30040539276a5f57d5564de8d7c48a506b2dddf583cb6317ef8c46ff4462c355`, preserves the source inventory, verification, earlier cleanup records and build-turn log. [Validation provenance](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ssb70KWXwUsf2qltsm8phum_leMsSjIJ/view), 1,326 bytes, SHA256 `d0e4f6c50f261f83e62516a66611b7f4c6c3ce79f6509e7fd06dc48ea5626828`, preserves four additional top-level validation/preflight logs, including the empty failed-attempt logs. Every archive member was verified; small original metadata/logs remain for restoration.
- **Local duplicate cleanup complete:** 1,099 closed PR129 parity and PR145 flop/turn files, **2,659,157,266 logical bytes (2.48 GiB)**, removed after accepted upload proof, source hash/stat, tracked-file, open-handle, external symlink and active-task future-input checks. Zero retained candidates. Each original result root has an `ARCHIVED-RESTORE-20261004.json` stub. [Compact receipt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wXZF-2AXJ5A7GvwdZgRJ1KePkBKN6K4E/view) and [complete per-file restoration journal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-qgLdo0RMbxhPovbnkymMRJEl-L7bsyD/view) identify exact source paths, member hashes and cloud archives. No synced payload was removed.
- **Measured free storage:** M1 **50,607,751,168 bytes (47.13 GiB)** after this cleanup; M4 **102,100,340,736 bytes (95.09 GiB)** at this scheduled check. Cache activity and the separate active campaign can change these figures.
- **Active PR149 remains protected:** its owning task has resumed from isolated hash-verified inputs; the third lineage is exporting. The earlier interruption/restoration record remains unchanged. Both M1 retrieval roots, original six input exports and the M4 campaign/isolated inputs remain protected through verified owning-task closeout. Archival does not launch or resume science.
- **Remaining inventory:** metadata found older result roots in the averaged-extraction worktree (1,385,757,798 bytes), postflop-replication (47,271,792), local-CFR (11,204,339), blueprint-search-followup (31,095,006) and fresh-install smoke/replay (3,163,375). Archive coverage, ownership and future dependencies must be checked before moving or removing these. Git, environments, default inputs, private credentials and unrelated projects remain available. Hourly checks/chat updates continue; the selected batch is complete, not the entire archival task.

### Older worktree evidence — October 4 15:38 UTC follow-up

[PR #158](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/158) passed all required checks with no findings and merged. The [worktree archival receipt](docs/artifacts/drive-worktree-archives-20261004.json) records the next admitted scopes and exact source/member identities.

Six previously uncovered M1 scopes are now accepted in Drive with exact cloud ID/name/size/parent readback after archive member verification:

| Whole archive | Cloud file | Bytes |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| PR105 M1 search-followup log supplement | [archive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x1Rzb0awwECqiDBTpu0vsft-bYiziyKO/view) | 939 |

| PR112 M1 human smoke evidence | [archive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ydTgsD-KTrVYe5fqAt2SUIYXWnrL67oz/view) | 2,516 |

The 43-member scaling supplement and one-member search log supplement preserve M1 byte variants absent from earlier M4 archives; original failure/preflight/recovery provenance remains retained. The [accepted supplement receipt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19VnUbGifCHbpb6ykVX_O1OmBKknLI51I/view) pins archive SHA256, parents and counts. Six separate staging archive duplicates outside Drive, 51,034,412 bytes, were removed only after accepted upload/hash/stat/open-handle checks. Demo/default and original training-parent inputs stay local for coding and future dependencies.

Cleanup removed **234 closed worktree files / 1,155,068,143 logical bytes (1.08 GiB)** from scaling, local-CFR and search-followup roots. Each matches either an already accepted historical archive member or the new exact supplement; current source hashes, stat identity, Git tracking, external symlinks, handles and PR149's future-input plan were checked. No retained candidates; restore stubs and the [complete per-file journal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oYI1s6iX1ktCKtbjtpmMvH4n3-8ck5_o/view) record the original namespace, SHA256 and cloud archive/member. [Cleanup receipt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WdO0dELyuqbhJ0PrhKPjsmukNVNO78_3/view). No synced Drive payload was removed.

Three additional M4 closed v0.4.0 validation projects are now whole member-verified archives in Historical-experiments and **accepted** by native uploaded/not-uploading/exact-size plus cloud metadata:

- [Final candidate validation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EvNvbDwG5eSyMIZwScOsSa16fm_9uDhE/view): 221 members / 45,748,783 source bytes; 41,553,141 compressed bytes.
- [Release validation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dznPFtSqhvw3arGSdaELUKi6VQ8aS2Y1/view): 303 members / 46,256,373 source bytes; 41,926,664 compressed bytes.
- [Benchmark candidate validation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NxYZfSkL93YqzRSPoew-oWDOonCuGsFU/view): 1,466 members / 117,258,316 source bytes; 88,929,227 compressed bytes.

All three M4 sources remain local pending closure/dependency/restore review. Reproducible browser/node/build dependencies were excluded; archived member counts differ from raw directory totals for that reason. Packaging worker 45080 has closed; do not duplicate these archives.

Measured M1 free space after worktree cleanup was **27,135,582,208 bytes (25.27 GiB)**, and M4 after release packaging **100,750,036,992 bytes (93.83 GiB)**. M1 DriveFS currently accounts for about 22.43 GiB allocated storage and the second PR149 retrieval about 4.39 GiB; automatic streaming cache reclamation remains gradual, with no forced offload.

PR149's owning task completed 120/120 exports, but lock-only qualification exceeded 5 GiB and stopped before main execution. Its 3,029 evidence files are retrieved/hash-verified; monitoring is paused awaiting memory engineering and explicit owner readmission. This is not permission for archival to delete its campaign, isolated/original inputs or any dated retrieval copy. Preserve all future dependencies through owning-task closeout. Remaining M4 inventory includes older primary blueprint roots (333,924,067 bytes, historical folders exist) and web smoke/benchmark evidence (22,238,751 bytes including browser dependencies); classify exact archive coverage and coding dependencies before further cleanup. Hourly follow-up remains active.

### Smaller M4 evidence — October 4 16:39 UTC follow-up

[PR #159](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/159) passed scope/full0/full1/test and GitGuardian with no findings and merged. The [small archive receipt](docs/artifacts/drive-m4-small-archives-20261004.json) records the new accepted files and cleanup proof.

Seven distinct pilot/web runs are now whole archives in Historical-experiments, **accepted uploaded** with native status and exact cloud ID/name/size/parent proof. They contain 991 source members / 21,973,467 source bytes and 6,390,066 compressed bytes. Browser dependencies, code, environments, private files and active research were excluded; original run files remain pending dependency/restore review.

Every archive embeds `ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json` and `RESTORE-README.txt`. Extract into a fresh directory; restore members beneath their original `Local/` project prefixes and verify the recorded SHA256. [Accepted receipt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aFqhov369NW_u096KjYroomLHbcQw3jp/view) and [native proof](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11bf8oPtR5fWhcDiWDiFuYyscVBi4mwzF/view) preserve all file IDs, hashes and counts. A read-only metadata helper encountered missing `os.listxattr` in macOS system Python; the retained incident uses `/usr/bin/xattr` instead, with no payload mutation.

Guarded cleanup removed **2,000 separate M4 originals / 542,265,399 bytes (0.51 GiB)**: 1,990 release-validation files matching the three previously accepted whole archives, and ten primary six-player slice files matching the existing exact Historical cloud files. No new duplicate slice archive was uploaded. Current source/member hashes, stable stat identities, Git tracking, external symlinks, open handles and current PR149 approval/future-input plans were checked before deletion. Excluded coding/browser files remain. Each root has an `ARCHIVED-RESTORE-20261004.json` stub. [Cleanup receipt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rTrA7DKpWWPNuTdTl3UIGMEkEEc-D4Y4/view) and [full per-file journal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PxmACpU9l_9V5YqMGhocEFCrOMST_cNX/view) map original paths to exact cloud IDs/members/hashes. Synced Drive payloads were untouched.

M1 measured free space is **26,401,132,544 bytes (24.59 GiB)**; M4 after the new packaging is **101,046,308,864 bytes (94.11 GiB)**. Cache reclamation remains gradual. PR149's owner-approved 7-GiB pilot now fits memory, but its forecast is at least 31.2 main hours against 17.9 available; the owning task stopped before main and awaits a compute decision. All 3,198 retrieved evidence files, its whole campaign, isolated/original inputs and every dated retrieval root remain protected. No archival-triggered science or restart is authorized.

Next: finish dependency/restore review for these small accepted originals, final closed-evidence inventory and routine documentation CI. Earlier snapshots below remain historical; hourly chat updates continue.

### Closed evidence inventory — October 4 17:39 UTC follow-up

[PR #160](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/160) passed all required checks with no findings and merged. The [inventory/closeout receipt](docs/artifacts/drive-final-inventory-20261004.json) classifies the remaining local material and preserves each new archive identity.

Four more whole files are **accepted uploaded**, with native uploaded/not-uploading/no-conflict/exact-size plus current cloud ID/name/size/parent proof:

| Whole archive | Cloud file | Bytes |

The two PR145 folders preserve six published main03 report files and three independent local-replay output files: 44,766,307 source bytes. Their nine source hashes were absent from the earlier native manifests. The two host-specific archival-provenance snapshots preserve 267 M1 members / 678,862,476 source bytes and 119 M4 members / 193,607,825 source bytes, including retained packaging failures/partials, helpers, catalogs and cleanup receipts. Snapshot manifests explicitly define their freeze; subsequent small receipts remain separate. All embedded source/member hashes verified. Private credentials are excluded. The intact 594,617,807-byte M1 snapshot uploaded through native Drive without chunking or the connector ingestion ceiling.

Cleanup removed **566 closed M4 pilot/web files / 15,223,811 bytes**, preserving **425 access-token/browser-profile files** for private/everyday dependencies. [Receipt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YZFuZPJpvot5hIFMGOy_GcsIm3MWHavC/view) and [full journal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qrTqWrPbrXt4FeD0UtAKmTK1lhQjaidk/view). Separately retained PR145 report copies and closed staging/partial archive bytes were removed only after accepted archive/member hash, fresh stat, tracked-file, symlink, handle and future-input checks: **13 M1 files / 625,968,177 bytes** and **one M4 partial / 75,280,207 bytes**. Every failed-partial byte remains in the accepted provenance snapshots, with original path/hash restore mappings. [M1 receipt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EpJ6UXK-5G8gad9e6VJjq1Om0F1RVpQS/view), [M1 journal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-h4G7pJY7YKoNczhNOlzieTvihVeuvoK/view), [M4 receipt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i4WrAv0mYUImnBKoNFw6b1JMna6DFXgO/view), [M4 journal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HYi1mwNNey1No6j9EsMkUZD-qSx8J1c8/view). No synced cloud payload was deleted.

The metadata-only sweep inspected 61 M1 and 35 M4 relevant scopes with zero access errors, excluding symlink payloads, Git/environments/build/browser caches, private credentials and unrelated projects. All identified **closed heavy evidence** in this inventory has accepted cloud coverage. Required A/default/C/average inputs and HU20/TP20/fresh-install fixtures remain local; source checkout reports/configs and the tracked `deepcfr-test` matrix dataset are coding material. Small current archive-management manifests/helpers/restore stubs remain available for lookup. This inventory is not permission to remove future inputs or an assertion that active research is closed.

**PR149 is now running its owner-authorized main phase** after all 61 qualification checks; its revised forecast is 15.54 hours against 16.69 available before reserve. This supersedes the earlier stopped-forecast snapshots. Its entire M4 campaign, every dated M1 retrieval root and every declared future/original input remain protected. The current inventory found about 19.3 GB logical bytes across four M1 retrieval roots; metadata counts overlap source copies and do not measure unique physical storage. Archival will not touch them before the owning task's verified closeout/canonical manifest.

After this cleanup M1 measured **27,178,016,768 bytes (25.31 GiB)** free and M4 **99,169,501,184 bytes (92.36 GiB)** free. Native cache and active PR149 writes explain changes between readings; no forced offload. Next: documentation CI and later protected-task archival only after verified closure. Hourly checks/chat updates continue while that authorized work remains.

### Current archive folders

Paths are relative to the research Drive folder. Upload status is a snapshot on October 4, not a promise of completion. The older folder manifests remain historical evidence; new whole archives embed member hashes and restoration instructions.

Other existing PR/M4 archive folders remain at the research root. M4 original paths retain restore stubs after accepted-upload cleanup; restore the recorded archive into a fresh local directory before computation. M1 links resolve to their native raw-backup folders under Historical-experiments. These links are restoration conveniences, not independent backups. Private credentials, Git internals and reproducible environments/caches were excluded and retained locally. Ordinary coding checkouts and fixtures remain available.

Let streaming reclaim cache space gradually, as requested by the owner. No immediate forced offloading is needed. **Never delete within the synced folder to free local space:** that deletes the cloud copy too. Separately retained inactive originals may be removed only after the accepted desktop completion check and dependency review. Restore research into a local working directory and verify the manifest before future computation.

## Historical October 2 archive and local cleanup

The owner accepted Google Drive desktop's **Successfully uploaded / Synced** status as the upload acceptance check. Inactive copies have now been removed: **8,722 files / 41,249,100,807 logical bytes (38.42 GiB)** across the primary checkout, PR144 evidence and temporary archive staging. The full removal/restore receipt is `LOCAL-CLEANUP-20261002.json` in the research Drive folder; the [compact cleanup record](docs/artifacts/local-cleanup-20261002.json) preserves totals, archive hashes, paths and exclusions.

- **PR144:** six complete archives in [PR-144-history-compression](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EnCmKftt50pebTWVtu1MvTUQEaw_5hCV). Download `archive-manifest.json` and `SHA256SUMS` from that folder; verify the selected archive, then extract its member path under a fresh restoration directory. The manifest maps every archive prefix to its original working root. Failed/partial attempts and all closed raw evidence remain in these archives. The original local retrieval paths in the [scientific report](docs/reports/dr2x2-ac-comparison.md) now require this restoration step.
- **Preserved locally:** original A inputs, six final C checkpoint/current files, six A/C average exports referenced by symlinks, working blueprint trees, tracked reports, private credentials and other agents' work.
- **Still uploading:** `branching-comparison.tar.gz` (14,041,643,443 bytes). Its original remains local until the desktop confirms completion.
- **M4:** read-only serial archival transfer started for 27 closed research result roots, including PR136, into separate PR/root folders. Uploads are **pending**, and every M4 original remains intact. Active exact-flop/turn experiment and its input root are excluded. Durable local progress: `/Users/dberweger/Local/research-archive-preparation-20261002/m4-archive-status.json`.
- **Git housekeeping:** 411 abandoned, unindexed temporary Git files were removed after checking age and open handles. All four repository HEAD trees remained readable. Free disk was about **120 GiB** immediately afterward; ongoing archive staging changes that figure. No committed Git pack, branch or scientific source was removed.

Large untracked training/evaluation artifacts are indexed here so a PR can link to their location without checking them into Git. Working files may live wherever convenient. During cleanup, archive them to the owner-designated [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/188bEt6i0RHqegCCdvpf3wPzUiRw78N2s).

## Current archive state

The September 30 catalog remains the original inventory: **8,117 files / 208 top-level entries / 48,465,009,999 logical bytes**. October 2 cleanup removed completed inactive entries after owner acceptance of Drive upload completion. The [catalog](docs/artifacts/results-catalog.json) now marks each removed or retained top-level entry. The October 4 section records subsequent completed branching upload and native staging; retained input dependencies still require review before duplicate cleanup.

- Original root: `/Users/dberweger/Local/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/results`.
- Streamed destination: `/Users/dberweger/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-dberweger2017@gmail.com/My Drive/deepcfr-research-results`.
- The original inventory names are retained. Current legacy paths gain the `Historical-experiments/` prefix where recorded in the October 4 relocation receipt; existing PR folders remain at the root.
- [Machine-readable catalog](docs/artifacts/results-catalog.json) records exact bytes/files and report references. Logical sizes include duplicate retained archives/extracted copies; they do not measure physical APFS storage.

## Cleanup and retrieval policy

1. Keep active checkpoints, recovery slots and other agents’ input dependencies in their working location. Coordinate before cleanup.
2. Preserve every attempt, failed/partial output, source/config/model identity, manifest/hash and exact retrieval command. Add the PR/report and archive relative path to this index. Never replace scientific evidence with a success-only archive.
3. New uploads originate only from the bb128 cache through `research_cache.py upload`; record its MD5/member-coverage receipt and the archive/manifest SHA256s. Mac Drive is read-only. Existing campaigns may finish their current route. The owner-approved cache cron alone may evict covered idle folders through seven-day trash; NVMe/Mac originals retain the separate authorization/dependency/cleanup-receipt rules. Keep pending uploads and active dependencies.
4. Before analysis, restore the needed immutable files into a working directory, verify their hashes and source/model identities, and keep restored heavy computation on the authorized host. Do not train or audit inside a streamed folder.

## Recent work outside the initial batch

These are the original working roots, outside the initial primary-checkout batch. October 4 staging places #132/#133 evidence in the PR folders above and preserves old paths as cloud links. #134 input dependencies remain local pending review.

## Initial batch table of contents

**Historical inventory; current removed/retained states are in the machine-readable catalog and October 2 cleanup record.** Report links identify associated research. Associated PRs identify the latest report-changing PR found in main history; they do not assert which run originally produced a file. Legacy/unmapped entries are retained for later identification.

## HU20 turn-search development (PR #148)

- External AGPL play/quality harness: `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-turn-search-tool`; upstream is a symlink to the unchanged pinned `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-exact-flop-tool/upstream`. Restore with commit 9d1509fe5077d019825f833eed04b16d342dfda1. Source/binary fingerprints: `docs/reports/hu20-turn-search-artifacts/external-inventory.json`. Never vendor these sources into MIT.
- M1 references, requests, responses, logs, profiles and receipts: `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-turn-search-20261002/m1-parity-reference-01` through `-08`; `-04` retains the failed inserted-wager fixture. Current reference is `-08`; thread comparisons are `m1-thread-parity-t1`, `-t4`, `-t6` under the same parent. Compact counts/hashes: `docs/reports/hu20-turn-search-artifacts/m1-parity.json`. Full profiles, the parent `status.md`, old references and both build logs remain retained. The M4 phase is indexed below; no rental has started.
- Inputs remain the preserved six exports in `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-m4-archive-20261002/hu20-exact-flop-check-inputs`; they remain other agents' dependencies.
- Keep all originals and failed builds/requests. Archive to the existing designated Drive destination with complete manifests and symlink retrieval provenance at cleanup. No local deletion is authorized.

- HU20 #148 M4 admission/pilot and future Part A: `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-turn-search-20261003` on M4; isolated MIT checkout `repo`, source 75cbda7 for the 156-hand pilot. Includes immutable admission, six input hashes, published #145 report copy, cumulative `budget.json`, initial helper startup failure, pilot log/launch, complete `pilot-01` hand archives/manifests and independent `pilot-01-verification.json`. Local transfer-verified copies: `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-turn-search-20261002/m4-pilot-01` and `m4-pilot-metadata-01`; helper/report provenance is retained in the same parent. Compact prospective count/power proof: `docs/reports/hu20-turn-search-artifacts/part-a-timing-freeze.json`. No artifact deletion or paid allocation is authorized by this entry.

- HU20 #148 final Part A: M4 `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-turn-search-20261003/part-a-01`, pushed source 5e4de63, 77,052 complete hands. Local full transfer-verified copy `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-turn-search-20261002/m4-part-a-01` includes original summary/manifest, replay, post-replay console failure and selection verification. Compact publication: `docs/reports/hu20-turn-search-part-a.md` and `hu20-turn-search-artifacts/part-a-result.json`. Preserve the original journal and attempts. External M4 harness uses a dedicated pinned upstream clone; build setup symlink failure/relocation and build/parity evidence remain at the same M4 root. No cleanup, paid allocation or original #145 binary replacement.

- HU20 #148 reference-bound calibration: full immutable ranges `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-turn-search-20261003/calibration-references-01.json` (19,002,241 bytes), proof `reference-freeze-proof-01.json`, external native sources/build logs/failures and `m4-parity-01` remain under the same M4 root. Compact index/settings are committed; all 144 selected-base references and original report/range/result hashes remain retrievable. Original #145 bytes/binary remain unchanged. No evidence eviction is authorized.

- HU20 #148 stopped calibration-01: M4 `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-turn-search-20261003/calibration-01` and full M1 copy `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-turn-search-20261002/m4-calibration-01`. All 94 manifest members (46,619,321 bytes) independently size/SHA verified. Guard/admission/launch/clock snapshots, 17 timeout rows, interrupted eighteenth request, logs and TensorBoard remain retained. Publication: [stopped curve](docs/reports/hu20-turn-search-calibration.md) and `docs/reports/hu20-turn-search-artifacts/calibration-01-stopped.json`. Family RSS guard stopped at 4.341 GiB against 4.25 GiB; processes exited, no swap growth, cumulative journal 5740.47 seconds. Recurring continuation is paused; [proposed readmission](docs/hu20-turn-search-resource-readmission.md) requires owner restart approval. No qualified setting, evidence eviction, automatic restart or rental.

- HU20 #148 owner-approved calibration-02: prospective settings `configs/diagnostics/hu20-turn-search-calibration-readmission-02.json`, source 2d761ca, fresh admission `docs/reports/hu20-turn-search-artifacts/calibration-02-admission.json`. Raw/preliminary admission and launch helpers retained at M4 `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-turn-search-20261003`; no new outcomes precede this freeze. Original stopped calibration-01 is retained separately, with no timing stitching or budget reset.

- HU20 calibration-02 is running from tested source 4105419, worker 18889/sidecar 18890. Final fresh admission snapshot was pushed at a5f4d48 before outcomes; preliminary snapshot is retained. Compact source/settings/admission/PID/clock provenance: [launch evidence](docs/reports/hu20-turn-search-artifacts/calibration-02-launch.json). Complete requests/responses/curve/status/TensorBoard/clock remain at M4 root `calibration-02`; local launch/helper/admission/validation evidence in `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-turn-search-20261002`. Original calibration-01 and #145 evidence stay untouched; no cleanup or paid allocation.

- HU20 #148 owner-approved clean stop of calibration-02: M4 `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-turn-search-20261003/calibration-02`, complete M1 copy `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-turn-search-20261002/m4-calibration-02-owner-stop`. All 1,752 manifest members / 1,614,849,743 bytes independently size/SHA verified. The full 238-row curve, requests/responses/receipts/manifests, TensorBoard, original incomplete summary, SIGTERM reason, owner stop request and append-preserving journal are retained. [Budget report](docs/reports/hu20-turn-search-calibration-02-budget.md), complete committed screen curve, stop/verification and timing-only forecast identify zero final rows, 18 unattempted reduced screen rows and no selected setting. Processes exited, swap unchanged, cumulative 12,053.465 seconds charged. The forecast-blocked settings proposal cannot launch; heartbeat PAUSED pending owner budget/scope decision. No calibration-01 stitching, evidence eviction or paid allocation. Earlier running/launch entries are historical.

- HU20 #148 approved retained-screen final preparation: `configs/diagnostics/hu20-turn-search-calibration-final-30-only-03.json` and `docs/reports/hu20-turn-search-artifacts/calibration-03-approved-forecast.json` prospectively bind the original 238-row screen hash, all six timing-selected configurations and 1,728 final coordinates. Three-hour river reserve enforced; 120-second continuation requires separate approval. Original calibration-02 remains immutable; new final evidence will use M4 `calibration-03`. No launch or cleanup is implied by this preparation entry.

- HU20 #148 calibration-03 resumed final: M4 `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-turn-search-20261003/calibration-03`, actual source 93d55eb (full CI passed), worker 87830/sidecar 87831. Fresh admission 70e445d preceded final outcomes. [Launch provenance](docs/reports/hu20-turn-search-artifacts/calibration-03-launch.json) pins settings/binary/source/admission/clock; full launch/helpers, charged preflight, CI proof and local status retained at `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-turn-search-20261002`. All 238 prior screen rows are copied with provenance; no screen rerun, no calibration-01 stitching or evidence cleanup. Expected 1,728 final coordinates, three-hour river reserve enforced. Preserve full raw requests/responses/shared receipts/curve/TensorBoard and original append-preserving journal. No paid allocation or automatic 120-second fallback.

- HU20 #148 completed calibration-03: all 1,728 final coordinates, no strict/relaxed thirty-second qualifier, all workers exited without guard failure. [Complete report](docs/reports/hu20-turn-search-calibration-03.md), [all 1,966 final/retained-screen rows](docs/reports/hu20-turn-search-artifacts/calibration-03-full-curve.jsonl) and [result/verification/journal](docs/reports/hu20-turn-search-artifacts/calibration-03-result.json) preserve every coordinate, law, receipt, timeout and exclusion. Raw M4 `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-turn-search-20261003/calibration-03`: 15,292 manifest members / 29,486,803,777 bytes independently size/SHA verified. Complete M1 retrieval `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-turn-search-20261002/m4-calibration-03-complete`, all 15,292 members independently size/SHA verified on M1; [retrieval proof](docs/reports/hu20-turn-search-artifacts/calibration-03-retrieval-verification.json) records final cumulative 42,294.351 seconds and retained TensorBoard hashes. The local publication/verifier helpers, admission, original journal snapshots and TensorBoard remain indexed there. Heartbeat PAUSED for owner decision; separate 120-second proposal/quote remains unapproved. Preserve originals and prior attempts; no eviction, rental, automatic restart or budget reset. Earlier running entries are historical.

PR149 M4 revision-3 mandatory disk stop, October 4: verified M1 copy `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-board-pooling-m4-retrieval-20261004`, 2,418 files / 1,084,490,993 bytes, zero member mismatches; [retrieval receipt](docs/reports/hu20-board-pooling-artifacts/m4-stop-retrieval.json). M4 dated original remains untouched, including nine complete exports, tenth partial, clock/failure and separate AGPL sources/binaries. Archive both to the existing PR149 Drive destination after dependency review; no cloud completion is claimed and no deletion is authorized. No solver values or paid cost. Original average inputs are still active dependencies for owner-authorized continuation.

PR149 second preparation stop, October 4: verified M1 copy `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-board-pooling-m4-retrieval-02-20261004`, 2,623 files / 4,697,713,515 bytes, zero mismatches; [receipt and isolated input restoration](docs/reports/hu20-board-pooling-artifacts/m4-stop-02-retrieval.json). Preserve the first immutable verified copy/receipt too. All 80 complete exports, both clocks/failures, separate AGPL sources/tools and restored source inputs are retained in the dated M4 campaign. **Active dependency: `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-board-pooling-20261004/inputs-restored-02` contains all three frozen average exports; retain it for owner-authorized resumption.** The shared original input alias was archived during preparation; it remains a restoration pointer and was not modified by this task. Restore provenance uses the retained M1 `hu20-m4-archive-20261002` copy; all original source hashes match on both Macs. Archive to the existing PR149 Drive destination after dependency review; no cloud completion or deletion authorization is claimed. Qualification/main unrun; heartbeat paused; $0 paid compute.

PR149 qualification RSS stop, October 4: third verified M1 copy `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-board-pooling-m4-retrieval-03-20261004`, **3,029 files / 10,125,291,134 logical bytes / 7,296,037,751 unique-inode bytes**, 82 verified hard-link groups, zero mismatches; [receipt](docs/reports/hu20-board-pooling-artifacts/m4-stop-03-retrieval.json). Preserve both older verified copies and immutable receipts. Dated M4 campaign retains all 120 complete compact exports, prepared-02 recovery dependencies, isolated source inputs, every failed attempt and external AGPL tools. First real V4 and converged pilot are descriptive qualification evidence; fresh lock-only failed the 5-GiB RSS ceiling and main never started. Heartbeat paused, $0 paid cost, no hypothesis decision. Archive to the existing PR149 destination only after dependency review; no cloud completion or deletion authorization is claimed. All source/recovery dependencies remain valuable for separately admitted bounded-memory continuation.

PR149 owner-approved 7-GiB worker readmission retains `prepared-03` and all three old retrieval copies as active dependencies. [Readmission-04 receipt](docs/reports/hu20-board-pooling-artifacts/m4-resume-04.json) rechecks 253 preparation/source members and all 120 native request/compact pairs; no solver result reuse. New `qualification-04`, `guard-qualify-04`, per-pilot resource records and approval/clock append remain in the dated M4 campaign for fresh hash-verified retrieval at closeout. No archiving, deletion, cloud completion or additional resource waiver is implied.

PR149 readmission-04 forecast stop: fresh M1 `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-board-pooling-m4-retrieval-04-20261004`, **3,198 files / 10,473,469,109 logical bytes / 7,644,215,726 unique-inode bytes**, 82 verified hard-link groups, zero mismatches; [receipt](docs/reports/hu20-board-pooling-artifacts/m4-stop-04-retrieval.json). All three older copies' manifest members reverified. The new copy uses rsync `--link-dest` for unchanged third-copy members, without changing their contents; preserve all copies/receipts and M4 originals. First fresh solve/lock fit 7 GiB, but forecast lower bound 31.182 hours exceeds 17.899 available before reserve; first replay interrupted, other pilots/main unattempted. Retain all 120 exports, isolated inputs, prepared-02/-03 recovery dependencies, new approval/resource/forecast-stop records and partial replay. Heartbeat paused; no inference, deletion/cloud completion or additional budget authorization; $0 paid cost. Existing PR149 Drive destination remains the eventual archive target after dependency review.

PR149 engineering amendment: external M1 `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-board-pooling-engineering-20261004` retains the fresh AGPL source/build, zero-CFR tests, parsing benchmark and copied compact M4 receipts. New M4 binary `pooling-engineering-05-mac`, source archive, exact pilot-0 reruns in `engineering-parity-05`, approval/clock append and `qualification-05` remain in the dated campaign. [Fingerprint](docs/reports/hu20-board-pooling-artifacts/engineering-amendment-05.json); [exact parity](docs/reports/hu20-board-pooling-artifacts/engineering-parity-05.json). Preserve all four prior verified copies/receipts and original binaries, prepared exports and isolated inputs. Compact new receipts are locally retained; full fresh retrieval is pending closeout. No cloud completion, deletion, extended allowance or rental is implied; eventual archive remains the existing PR149 destination.

PR149 engineering-05/main preemptive memory stop: fifth verified M1 copy
`/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-board-pooling-m4-retrieval-05-20261004`, **3,476 files /
12,124,413,687 logical bytes / 9,295,160,304 unique-inode bytes**, 82 hard-link
groups, zero mismatches; [verification](docs/reports/hu20-board-pooling-artifacts/m4-stop-05-retrieval.json).
All four older immutable copies and manifest members reverified; retain them
and the dated M4 original unchanged. New qualification-05 passes 61 gates;
main-05 retains one atomic collect and one partial, zero common boards.
External M1 `hu20-board-pooling-engineering-20261004/real-pool-preflight` holds
three data-only statistics fixtures, eager/streamed byte-identical policy files
and capacity receipts; synthetic split metadata is engineering-only. New
bounded driver repair remains on M1, not deployed/readmitted to M4. Native
engineering source/binary, archive, prepared exports, isolated inputs and
clock/stop/admission receipts remain valuable dependencies. Heartbeat PAUSED,
owned work stopped, $0 paid cost. Existing PR149 Drive destination remains the
eventual archive target after dependency review; no upload/cloud completion,
delete authorization, automatic restart or extra allowance is implied.

PR149 main-06 completed October 5: **120 solves, 120 locked evaluations, 18 replay checks and all 40 common boards**, no main exclusions or failures. [Frozen report](docs/reports/hu20-board-pooling.md) and [resource/response verification](docs/reports/hu20-board-pooling-artifacts/m4-main-06/resources.json) retain D=0.1943 [0.1550, 0.2359] and passing 5% missing-key coverage. The complete raw campaign has **5,740 file members / 56,262,193,754 logical bytes / 53,432,940,371 unique-inode bytes**, plus symlink/hard-link provenance. Git administration alone is excluded; every working source and exact runtime commit e0c91d25 are retained. It is packed losslessly at M4 `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-board-pooling-closeout-06-20261005/hu20-board-pooling-m4-complete-20261005.tar.gz` (**16,802,192,861 bytes**, SHA256 `20ad0f67df71464e7c06bdb1cf63451c243944c14e732b83650861f8f9bbcaed`); manifest SHA256 `d5608ba75a785dfc5633f96dc27246d1b0c7781e478e67bc31972163565fca65`.

A separate APFS clone is hash-verified and staged through native Drive desktop at `M1-board-pooling/M4-main-06-20261005/` in the [existing PR149 archive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13SUnP_d1ZVtcyJAp-oqRecg5Wv3SYIfy); **cloud upload was originally pending; October 5 native acceptance, current cloud name/size/parent and staged SHA256 checks now confirm the archive**. Fresh M1 `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-board-pooling-m4-retrieval-06-20261005` contains the hash-verified 240-record compact reporter input and exact scientific reporter replay; the full compressed archive and **all 5,740 file members now hash-verify with zero mismatches**, preserving 82 hard-link groups. [Closeout receipt](docs/reports/hu20-board-pooling-artifacts/m4-main-06/retrieval.json) records every member/archive check, all five prior-copy checks and the recovered transport interruption. Verification streamed the lossless archive without expanding the 56-GB campaign. All five older immutable M1 retrieval copies reverify with zero mismatches. Preserve every original, isolated input, prepared-02/-03 recovery dependency, old stop receipt and the external AGPL tools; no deletion/eviction authorization. $0 paid, no rental, no training or merge.

PR149 final compact report, resource/replay checks, independently verified retrieval receipt, reporter replay and current roadmap/index are also staged as nine hash-verified documents under `M1-board-pooling/M4-main-06-20261005/report-closeout/`; [staging manifest](docs/reports/hu20-board-pooling-artifacts/m4-main-06/closeout-staging.json). This supplements the immutable whole raw archive; it does not claim cloud completion or authorize deletion.

- HU20 #166 stages 1–3, October 5: river evidence remains on M4 `~/Local/hu20-turn-search-river-20261005/river-01`; terminated pilot evidence (parity, every solver request, timing hands, manifests and failures) remains on M1 `~/Local/hu20-turn-search-pilot-20261005/evidence`. Formal quote preparation, raw authenticated MCP catalog/billing replies and local read helper are retained at M1 `~/Local/hu20-turn-search-quote-20261005`; no credentials are written there. Compact [quote/report/reproduction](docs/reports/hu20-turn-search-arena-quote.md) is committed with all timing-input sizes/hashes. The $18.25 three-pod 3090 proposal remains unapproved; CPU5 exceeds the $25 ceiling. No production allocation, archival/cleanup authorization, or changes to the four old exited pods.

- HU20 #166 quote revision 2: [revised report](docs/reports/hu20-turn-search-arena-quote-02.md), quote/profile inventory and immutable MCP/compression reads bind the fixed request-SHA lowest-1% sampling policy. Local measurement helpers/raw replies remain at M1 `~/Local/hu20-turn-search-quote-20261005/revision-02`. No existing profile body was deleted: revision measurements only read the original pilot; compression streamed to a byte counter. Future new production pods retain every hand/request/receipt/response plus SHA/size of every generated profile, and only sampled bodies; user-requested unsampled deletion follows durable hashing on those pods. Lossless compressed chunks preserve exact member bytes/hashes without raw expansion on the Macs. The new $6.03 mean/$16.25 maximum proposal remains unapproved and stock-conditional. Original quote and all original evidence remain retained; no general Mac cleanup authorization.

- HU20 #166 owner-approved launch preparation: M1 `~/Local/hu20-turn-search-arena-20261005` retains the explicit chat approval record, approved plan/quote, fresh catalog reads and an immutable 434 MiB copy of the M4 pilot transfer bundle. Approved evaluator/solver source remains `6a5ff44`; separate operational scripts add fail-closed checkpoint admission, actual-host preflight and streaming evidence verification. No original Mac evidence is changed. Every paid creation/readback and provisioning-clock charge will be recorded before dependent work.

- HU20 #166 first admission rejection: `m589v6gr99fdab` (two RTX 3070s, $0.26/hour) had 37.4 quota CPUs but only 48,999,997,440 cgroup RAM bytes. No solver/arena ran. Compressed admission evidence/member manifest/stream verification/termination/readback are retained at M1 `~/Local/hu20-turn-search-arena-20261005/retrieved/m589v6gr99fdab`; creation/catalog/quote receipts, ledger and the new rental-plan request are in its parent. Newly owned pod terminated; old exited pods untouched. Owner now requires the exact next rental plan before any further allocation.

- HU20 #166 stage-4 mixed-fleet handoff/cost gate: M1 `~/Local/hu20-turn-search-arena-20261005/stage-4-mixed` retains owner-named pod readbacks, raw v1/v2 SSH measurement transcripts, actual admission records, empty initial billing response, sleep-charge exclusion, ownership handoff and actual-fleet quote. CPU quotas 17.85/18.7/18.7/13.6/10.2 require eight slots; full five-pod maximum $26.14 exceeds $25. Alternative four-pod/six-slot quote $21.22 awaits owner approval. No solver, parity or arena outcomes exist from this attempt. All five named transferred pods remain active pending decision; old exited pods unchanged.

- HU20 #166 stage-4 approved mixed-fleet execution: [launch record](docs/reports/hu20-turn-search-arena-stage-4.md). M1 `~/Local/hu20-turn-search-arena-20261005/stage-4-mixed` retains the owner handoff/approvals, 5080 termination and 404, actual v1/v2 admissions, immutable input/operations hashes, fresh quote/ledger and PR status comments. M4 `~/Local/hu20-turn-search-arena-20261005/stage-4-mixed` owns the durable supervisor, one-time per-pod dispatch receipts, authenticated remote-controller snapshots and complete actual-host gates; future retained chunks and stream/member verification belong under `retrieved/<pod-id>`. Coordinates 0–3 began at 16:14 UTC after both 3070s passed checker and 96/96 exact replay; coordinates 4–5 are reserved for separately admitted 3080 Ti hosts. Full worker-count remains six. Science source/green CI is `6a5ff44`; evaluation is in progress, with no strength or completion claim. No scientific restarts, new rentals, original Mac evidence changes, or historical-pod mutations.

- HU20 #166 stage-4 stopped closeout (October 5): [final report](docs/reports/hu20-turn-search-arena-stage-4.md) supersedes the historical running entries above. M4 `~/Local/hu20-turn-search-arena-20261005/stage-4-mixed/retrieved/<pod-id>` retains every compressed evidence chunk, archive/member SHA and size manifest, sealed stream-verification receipt and termination/readback. Its parent retains exact 500-decision controller counts (86 timeout fallbacks), partial 13,560-hand summary, spend estimate, raw posted billing, final list-pods and closeout/report receipts. M1 retains copied final metadata at the same relative path. All five owned pods terminated; protected historical pods and original Mac evidence unchanged. Frozen protocol incomplete; no full strength contrast or restart. Posted billing $0.957235 through 16:00 UTC; full provisioning estimate $1.587550 gross/$1.068661 cap-counted after sleep exclusion, final invoice pending. No destructive local evidence cleanup.

- HU20 #166 stage-4 archive/posted-billing refresh: `~/Local/Research-Cloud/PR-166-HU20-turn-search-arena/stage-4-closed-M4-20261005.zip` (541,375,924 bytes, SHA-256 `d4ff034cd19d6e6fd8db39313ceba16ff76031d86bc5bc8b74dfea87a87defc6`) and `stage-4-closed-M1-20261005.zip` (6,372,654 bytes, SHA-256 `aee43e7c031cf5b2cac8b7f67b6ee6367e95fc196d11227fb4dbf11482de8777`) contain the raw chunks, sealed manifests, all partial evidence, original report failure and successful closeout. Embedded archive inventories and destination/member verification receipts accompany the ZIPs. Credentials/caches excluded; originals preserved. New read-only MCP billing: $1.170743 posted gross/$0.651854 after owner sleep exclusion, including final bucket through 17:00 UTC. Hardware-independent proposal metadata and billing refresh will be retained in a separate research ZIP. No stopped-run hand is reused.

- HU20 #166 prospective fixed-work revision 3: [protocol/quote](docs/hu20-fixed-work-arena-proposal.md) and compact [timing, proposed plan and quote](docs/reports/hu20-fixed-work-arena/) retain the full 464-request stage-4 timing index, immutable 24-request completed/censored sample, six-thread cost-only CPU measurements, exact macOS scientific-profile comparison, latest MCP offers and posted-billing refresh. Full request/profile/log bodies, excluded default-thread diagnostic and original RSS-only raw-hash comparison failure are zipped as `~/Local/Research-Cloud/PR-166-HU20-turn-search-arena/fixed-work-proposal-M4-20261005.zip` (353,579,275 bytes, SHA-256 `e4987d936053eb8276120eff235e21c42356cee33ab181590408e7ef2031fc0b`, 1,768 verified members). A separate M1 proposal ZIP retains the source snapshot, isolated AGPL harness bundle/build, MCP replies, approval proposal and publication receipts. Originals remain preserved; no stage-4 hand is reused. No paid host allocated; owner chat approval and each actual-host parity/retention/cost gate remain pending.

- HU20 #166 revision-3 publication/archive seal: [approval comment 6000059021](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/166#issuecomment-6000059021) binds source `249a79b`, proposed plan canonical SHA256 `8a4e939f7058e0a85d281ef1a069e90bf0b63465f3f115c0f095ac888216e42e` and quote-file SHA256 `ffea2f314a39a1d6372e37feb6c0b0b42f6cb26df5418faf7cef5d7d2fce5a95`. Final M1 proposal ZIP is `~/Local/Research-Cloud/PR-166-HU20-turn-search-arena/fixed-work-proposal-M1-final-20261005.zip` (1,644,611 bytes, SHA256 `8b2ea740094ef8cd9453cf8eb8acfe05a776ff3a9f209718293536ce468d556b`, 35 verified members), containing source snapshot, AGPL source bundle/build identity, raw MCP offers/billing, quote, plan, PR comment/body and publication/CI receipts. The prior preliminary M1 proposal ZIP remains preserved. Both M4 ZIPs were copied and every archive/member reverified at this destination; originals preserved. [Linux CI](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/actions/runs/37352006086) is in progress on the exact proposed scientific source. Await chat approval; no rental or arena launched.

- HU20 #166 revision-3 approved stock attempt: [report](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/166#issuecomment-6000829086) supersedes the prior pending-approval status. Owner chat approval, green scientific/operational CI, 120 exact macOS references and sealed source-bound bundle are retained on both Macs at `~/Local/hu20-turn-search-arena-20261005/revision-3-run-01/`. RunPod rejected both approved-shape placement attempts; zero pods created/$0 new spend/no arena started. Every request/error receipt and fresh empty list-pods are retained. `~/Local/Research-Cloud/PR-166-HU20-turn-search-arena/fixed-work-approved-stock-attempt-M4-20261005.zip` is 1,479,190,279 bytes/SHA256 `af02f9c59ac85b9741cf1fbc69ff98c98c883757e675c0cc36a48082a49f7f32`, 2,303 verified members; corresponding M1 ZIP is 155,949 bytes/SHA256 `de12d548a8e61c31a45eead05501e2a430e913727fdc0cc63394e1c123a273ae`, 74 verified members. Embedded manifests and verification receipts accompany both, with originals preserved and credentials excluded. The M4 ZIP's relative source `.` means the exact M4 run root above. No stock guarantees, Linux parity claim, automatic retry, alternate fleet or old-hand reuse.

- HU20 #166 equivalent-search owner closeout: [handoff](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/166#issuecomment-6001549575), [compact seal](docs/reports/hu20-fixed-work-arena/owner-closeout-20261005.json). Owner requested all work closed until tomorrow. All large budget-qualified placements failed without creation; admission-only 3070 `hewb8i6o4eji98` was the sole new pod. Before resource admission/build/parity/arena began, its controller/setup evidence was retrieved as a lossless compressed chunk and every member hash verified, then deletion/404 and fully paginated empty list-pods confirmed. No new hands/decisions; provisioning-clock new upper charge $0.004278, cumulative cap spend $0.670942 pending posted billing. The $20 ceiling/$16 dispatch rule and fixed-50/zero-fallback science persist; newest operational CI was cancelled on closeout and must be green before future dispatch. Both Macs retain `~/Local/hu20-turn-search-arena-20261005/revision-3-run-02/` provenance and compact closeout; M4 also retains frozen bundles/references. Originals preserved, credentials/caches excluded, all four historical protected pods untouched. Research ZIPs, each verified against every member and accompanying embedded manifest, are in `~/Local/Research-Cloud/PR-166-HU20-turn-search-arena/`:
  - `fixed-work-equivalent-closeout-M1-20261005.zip`: 217,363 bytes, SHA256 `5257f0e723cbda3013a898f551ee7ae32ccd0db18c7dcb9e08f510bd6bd2f625`, 114 verified members.

  No automatic retry, schedule, background evaluation, merge or promotion. Fresh stock/quote, current source CI and actual-host exact parity/retention/cost admission are prerequisites for an owner-resumed attempt.

- HU20 #166 completed attempt 2: [frozen report](docs/reports/hu20-fixed-work-arena/attempt-2-closeout.md), [compact primary/sensitivity results](docs/reports/hu20-fixed-work-arena/attempt-2-results.json) and [archive seal](docs/reports/hu20-fixed-work-arena/attempt-2-archive.json). All 82,944 hands / 20,736 complete lineage pairs independently native-replayed; one defect-affected LBR pair excluded only in sensitivity, five guarded automatic partition restarts, zero missing final pairs. Full evidence from all three pods verified on M1 before MCP deletion/404/all list pages; all pods gone. Whole research root `~/Local/hu20-turn-search-arena-20261005/revision-3-run-03/` archived without deleting originals: `~/Local/Research-Cloud/PR-166-HU20-turn-search-arena/attempt-2-full-closeout-M1-20261006.zip`, **5,645,638,363 bytes**, SHA256 `cac0d2a766a8d0276820662112b68bb12ffe3688b8597faa0f63d43a829b3a0e`, **1,433 member files** all verified against the embedded manifest. Nested pod archives preserve 125,156 independently verified members, solver inputs/profiles, controller histories, failures, interrupted streams and resume logs. Exact approved/launched/closeout source snapshots and the frozen input bundle are included. Authentication files excluded. A separate `attempt-2-publication-seal-M1-20261006.zip` (**250,264 bytes**, SHA256 `32fe458e412c3a1500165f0900cb40e446b0e3e07cd5e66bf7d22c291dc76c12`, **23 verified members**) and adjacent verification receipt retain subsequent report publication/CI/timer-disable metadata; its files overlay the earlier snapshot. Native Drive upload confirmation remains pending; no local evidence removal, synced-folder deletion, eviction or unrelated PR cleanup is authorized. Earlier stage-4 and attempt-1 evidence remain archived/excluded.

## M4 originals removed after verified upload — October 5, 2026

Owner-authorized cleanup removed 3,399 hash-verified merged #149/#162/#163 original result files and separate local compressed archive copies. M4 free space rose from 19.2 to **69.3 GB**, approximately **50.0 GB reclaimed**. Canonical Drive archives remain; #149 preparation/input/source/tool folders, #162 input/source folders, shared Git and open #166/#169 work remain protected. M1 and #165 originals were unchanged. Historical retention entries are superseded only for the exact removed paths in the [cleanup receipt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nldLqO9B2Ln4E-jCLfE3UseCqK2G7exX/view).

Future merged research originals may be removed under the owner's authorization once matching Drive uploads verify and dependency review passes. Open PR roots and dependencies remain protected; no synced file deletion, forced offloading or unattended cleanup is authorized by this record.

## PR169 M4 scoring originals removed — October 6, 2026

PR169 is **merged**. Its completed [scoring archive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17X9Fpi1gNL0BVU24iN6xGBuoIMG8_Jpa/view) preserves all 54 exports, 40 held-out roots, input/reference copies, raw outputs, failures, plots and pinned source 6fd63e0. ZIP size 1,869,797,825 bytes; SHA256 `198301d2c14a8abf35a1567c241e96254294c10941ebca7efc96ae92c15170c7`.

### October 6: research models excluded from Git and forensic duplicates cleaned

The owner requested that unreleased model binaries live in Research-Cloud and be retrieved only when needed. `.gitignore` now covers local planning, serialized model formats and research archive bundles. AGENTS.md requires hash-verified retrieval into ignored working directories and explicit owner approval for exact-path release model exceptions. Source, reports and retrieval manifests remain available in the repository.

The M1 forensic copies `planning/forensics/scratch/c4k.pt` and `c16k.pt` were created locally on September 20, 2026, after merged [PR #89](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/89). Neither path has commits in the checked branch/tag/remote/T3-ref history. T3 checkpoint staging repeatedly read the unignored files, hit its 30-second VCS timeout and left partial packs. Equivalent staging with local exclusions now completes in 1.4 seconds.

Both canonical archives and the selected members were freshly rehashed, their embedded manifest entries matched, native Drive reported uploaded/no uploading/no conflicts, and cloud ID/name/size/parent checks passed. PR #89 was rechecked as merged. No tracked references were found across 46 registered worktrees, no selected model was open, and the only local filename references were historical forensic output JSON. Two local duplicates (1,472,371,059 bytes) were removed; the accepted archives and historical analysis files remain available.

Removed 82 additional Git-reported garbage packs (33,710,801,880 bytes), each older than two minutes, unchanged and without open handles. Full Git integrity and reachable-object checks passed before and after cleanup. No valid packs, refs, primary index, active PR roots or synced payloads were deleted. Temporary pack count is zero; M1 measured about 51 GB free after both cleanups. Matching local model exclusions protect existing project checkouts on both Macs while the repository rules land; other repositories retain their prior settings.

[Model cleanup receipt and original-path restoration commands](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XgRadPHdyCnp17SUg-9t7zDIZa5P-TjB/view), [temporary-pack cleanup receipt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11pRy40cfqt38Q781JyLO1rAsFoc_yHaa/view). [Retrieval commands and archive hashes](docs/artifacts/research-model-storage-20261006.md) show how to fetch the models into ignored `results/retrieved/pr89/` and verify them. The shared index retains the same Drive ID. This does not schedule cleanup or offload synced files.

## PR207 HU100 1B: verified science and local archive; owner upload handoff — October 9

Final scientific evidence, frozen source **bd0e7a417064f736091dc2b667954b50becb4b69**, fresh seed 2026100601, isolated M4 root ~/Local/hu100-1b-growth-20261008, feature/hu100-1b-growth. [PR207](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/207), [report](docs/reports/native-hu100-growth-1b.md), [audited model index](docs/reports/native-hu100-growth-1b-artifacts/model-index.json).

Training reached 1,000,002,065 nodes /41,010,014 entries; all five checkpoint/current/average sets audit. Fixed 143,360 distinct final hands fully replay/reproduce. Loose gain +214.39 [122.28,306.51] improves; tight +37.05 [−15.00,89.10] inconclusive, 97.5% each. Separate pot translation gain +62.45 [17.15,107.76], 95%. No model default/release change.

Existing Research-Cloud [PR-207-hu100-1b folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qhlOHmphBGSFfiM82S7T4B_KhdabyRUS), parent **188bEt6i0RHqegCCdvpf3wPzUiRw78N2s**. New local ZIP **hu100-1b-campaign-M4-retry-20261009.zip**, **20,517,119,304 bytes**, whole SHA256 **ba3e82d8fa79be32d445c54eb240069c4a717cb75af9713f3eaf7ac86364fddf**. Embedded **ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.json**, SHA256 **609d4899a363b384aa58b0daaef2ff85f2bcae7b135c2a4e3604813fc4182d58**. All **948 member files** read back and match size/SHA256, including the 15 required model members below. [Local verification receipt](docs/reports/native-hu100-growth-1b-artifacts/archive-receipt.json). Archive-only packing source **211cfdc590d77da1f8f4bf4440d38a858dafa26b**; scientific source remains unchanged.

**Upload started; cloud acceptance is pending and delegated to the owner.** At 05:31:26 UTC, native provider reports isUploading=1 /isUploaded=0, matching ZIP name/size; supported Foundation NSFileVersion query reports zero unresolved versions, with no reported native upload error. **Actual cloud archive ID is not yet registered/claimed; independent cloud ID/name/size/parent acceptance and remote byte verification are not claimed.** [Dated native handoff](docs/reports/native-hu100-growth-1b-artifacts/native-upload-status.json). The owner explicitly instructed: “You just have to start the drive upload, don’t wait for it to finish I will delete the originals as soon as it’s uploaded not before making sure the hashes match”. All originals remain; the agent does not delete them or wait for upload. The accepted cloud restoration pointer must be recorded after the owner's upload/hash verification; current commands use the fully verified local M4 ZIP, or the same archive downloaded after acceptance.

Retained failures: duplicate historical-root setup refusal before pilot hands; initial excessive storage forecast that block-scaled fixed snapshots; locked-keychain/SSH push provenance; **original archive +829.38 MiB swap-growth guard breach** and subsequent cleanup PermissionError. Original failure latch/baseline and logs are in the new ZIP. The **3,354,661,317-byte original partial** remains untouched at ~/Local/Research-Cloud/PR-207-hu100-1b/hu100-1b-campaign-M4-20261008.zip, SHA256 **92fba1a9ab9ab720fc667850d4570a2f427f2c602dc5e2c0deac78a5ed589004**; external partial provenance is embedded in the new manifest. It has no accepted final manifest/upload and must not be used for restoration. Owner-authorized pack retry capped total swap at **3,000,000,000 bytes**, preserved the original baseline and all other guards, and passed in120.42s. A later read-only upload waiter was stopped before acceptance after review found an unsupported conflict-field inference; supported Foundation query and one-shot pending handoff repaired it. [Original stop](docs/reports/native-hu100-growth-1b-artifacts/archive-stop-readback.json), [archive-only resources](docs/reports/native-hu100-growth-1b-artifacts/archive-resources.json).

The new ZIP retains gates, timing-only pilot, every main save/current/average, raw final/reproduction hands/decisions, runtime/source/environment/build/tests, frozen schedules, scientific resource streams and earlier failure logs. Current archive/upload/evidence-review lifecycle receipts are compact Git records; there is no extra metadata seal. All originals, shared Git, open-PR dependencies and synced partials stay intact; no cleanup or forced offload. Restoration depends on the archived native binary, scientific source and environment requirements; it does not restart the campaign.

## PR216 HU200 M1 feasibility — October 9, 2026

Final bounded scientific run, source **02e4ddebf37674d2fa32cb494d440347fd5b59a9**, fresh HU200 seed **2026100905**, isolated M1 root `/Users/dberweger/Local/deepcfr-hu200-slumbot/results/hu200-pilot-20261009`, branch `feature/hu200-slumbot-preparation`, base `6e18043317817080fd38f400c5366fbf18fc6b53`. [PR216](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/216): the owner subsequently authorized merge after review/CI and will finish cleanup; this user explicitly authorized archival of its own open evidence. Live status was checked before qualification copies, archive creation and report receipt copies. [Report](docs/reports/hu200-feasibility.md), [model/dependency index](docs/reports/hu200-feasibility-artifacts/model-index.json), [resources](docs/reports/hu200-feasibility-artifacts/resources.json).

Fresh 200BB training retains **20,002,716** and **100,000,034** actual-node endpoints, plus the 1,001,231-node admission measurement. All nine checkpoint/current/average files fully audit; 320 fixed offline scripted hands replay/reproduce. Local computation including source snapshot, training/save/export/audit/smoke/archive/readback/closeout ends in **1,433.43s /23.89min** under the single 60-minute clock. No resource breach, stop, failed pilot operation or retry. Review rounds 1/2's source defects and their corrections are retained; round 3 cleared exact source before training. These are single-seed feasibility records, not strength or Slumbot qualification. M4 untouched; no release/live/paid/1B/10B campaign.

[Local archive receipt](docs/reports/hu200-feasibility-artifacts/archive-receipt.json). The ZIP includes raw stage logs/resources, smoke actions/seeds, qualification/parity/review fixtures, source snapshot and runtime. Post-archive operation/closeout/upload/final-review lifecycle receipts remain compact Git records; no second evidence ZIP was produced.

Native Drive reports **uploaded /not uploading /not paused**, stable name/size/mtime, no reported upload error and **zero unresolved conflicts** through the supported Foundation query. Independent Drive metadata confirms archive ID **1_DurWi5ox9jcVYsJw2fYGAhdqB-JUapR**, exact name/2,414,034,193-byte size and parent folder. [Upload acceptance](docs/reports/hu200-feasibility-artifacts/archive-upload-acceptance.json). **No remote archive bytes were downloaded or verified**; complete member/whole hashes are local verification. The owner requested upload-only handoff and will finish cleanup; the one-shot handoff check was already uploaded. No upload waiter, cleanup or monitoring remains. The post-pilot reviewer’s terminated 3.82GiB single-line header-read attempt is preserved separately in [review round4](docs/reports/hu200-feasibility-artifacts/evidence-review-4.json); excluded from validation and not a pilot guard breach.

All local originals and synced archive remain. No deletion, forced offload, M4 use or cleanup of another PR occurred. The recorded native runtime has SHA256 **c72e900bc6e47e1c2ae78f7b16d87afbd2e9397adb946a86149e6ab4160a6878**; restore its `runtime/hu20-trainer` member and selected `source.tar` snapshot using the exact member hashes in the model index. Full repository source is the pinned Git revision. Later CLI help/report integration does not relabel the execution source or archived binary. Supported reproduction environment is Python 3.11.15 with pinned pokers 0.2.0 and the archived requirement files. Do not restart training through a retrieval command.

Restore selected model members into a fresh ignored directory. Download the linked archive into a fresh ignored path and set `PR216_ARCHIVE` accordingly, or read the existing verified Research-Cloud ZIP without creating another local ZIP. Select any target `1000000`, `20000000` or `100000000`, and comma-separated kinds `checkpoint,current,average`. This default restores only the terminal average. The command verifies the whole local/downloaded archive, embedded manifest and each selected member; it makes no remote byte claim until a remote download actually occurs.

## PR217 HU200 paired playing diagnosis — October 9, 2026

Final fresh comparison, **owner-authorized merge of [PR217](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/217)**, branch `feature/hu200-playing-diagnosis`, base `4c4e04c`, scientific source **57d9705de423e70370ba59243d9f398b62104207**. M1 root `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu200-playing-diagnosis-20261009/results/run-01`; single locked worker, final root **2026100906**, excluded timing root **2026100907**. [Protocol](docs/hu200-playing-diagnosis.md), [report](docs/reports/hu200-playing-diagnosis.md), [frozen plan/input identities](docs/reports/hu200-playing-diagnosis-artifacts/frozen-plan.json). #216's live status was confirmed **MERGED** before immutable input reads; own PR was **OPEN** before the explicitly owner-authorized archive creation. No other open root, shared Git, model or M4 dependency was copied/moved/cleaned.

**2,048 fixed paired blocks/opponent /40,960 hands /155,954 actions /71,482 candidate decisions** complete; all actions/events/settlements replay and both policies' actions reproduce. Independent native full-sample actor/legal/menu/key/settlement parity has zero mismatches. Five Bonferroni primary gains: loose **+278.58 [77.12,480.03] BB/100** improves, others inconclusive. Terminal still loses to loose/pot; unsupported pot histories and sparse covered late streets remain distinct diagnostic priorities, without causal loss attribution. Source/final review is primary-agent review, not independent reviewer approval. No new training, recipe change, live service, release, retry or evaluation failure; all valid calibration/final raw evidence retained. Science includes hash/header/snapshot/calibration/evaluation/replay/primary report/local ZIP/readback/closeout in **361.63s /6.03min** under 60 minutes, no guard breach. Compact post-closeout tabulation and independent recount are administrative report work (2.08s /3.96s), with no new hands/inference.

Use PR216's restoration command with `PR216_TARGET=20000000` then `100000000`, each `PR216_KINDS=average`, in separate fresh ignored destinations. It verifies archive, manifest and selected members. Restore the native runtime from that manifest only when needed; accepted full training audits are not repeated here. The input verification receipt/headers are in the frozen plan and original worker costs; supported environment is Python **3.11.15**, pinned pokers **0.2.0**, NumPy/SciPy and original requirements.

To regenerate compact exploratory tables after restoring, use the committed `python -m scripts.report_hu200_diagnosis --root RESTORED --out NEW_IGNORED_OUTPUT`; it performs an independent full raw-record/count/paired-gain recount before tabulation. The archived frozen scientific source runs `scripts.evaluate_hu200_diagnosis` workers/report and the pinned native parity command. Relocated input paths require a recorded relocated plan/new plan digest; model bytes, roots, schedule and behavioral settings must remain exact. Fresh reruns require separately admitted budgets, not this one-use controller. Review, PR administration and later upload acceptance do not modify this sealed scientific run or authorize cleanup.

## PR218 HU200 action translation calibration stop — October 9, 2026

**Partial, terminal scientific attempt; no final comparison.** [PR218](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/218), branch `feature/hu200-action-translation`, base current main `a3358fc`, scientific source **734b4f1093c963d15a81d12b3e5de209f95ba613**. M1 worktree `/Users/dberweger/Local/hu200-action-translation-20261009`, run root `results/run-01`. #216/#217 live statuses were **MERGED** before input use; PR218 **OPEN** before explicitly owner-authorized own-evidence archival. Independent source reviews clear explicit HU200 support and unchanged HU100 translation. [Protocol](docs/hu200-action-translation.md), [report](docs/reports/hu200-action-translation.md), [authoritative final partial receipt](docs/reports/hu200-action-translation-artifacts/final-partial-summary.json).

Fresh normal-pressure/AC admission passed at 15:44:44 UTC with 24.827GiB disk and 4.214GiB available RAM. The owner retained **15.5GiB** disk floor. Calibration pressure changed `1→2` at 123.48s, sampled family peak **1,629,061,120 bytes**, zero swap growth; guard killed its worker and latched science off. **439 recoverable timing-only records**: off 320/on 119 (on gzip footer interrupted), actions 1195/592, candidate decisions 557/286, native fixtures 320/118. No calibration payoffs inspected, no costs receipt, sample freeze, native parity, final hand, gain/uncertainty or performance/adoption claim. Original archive admission also refused pressure before any ZIP started. Normal-pressure archive-only continuation retained original swap/disk/time baseline and terminal science latch; no science restart or hand regeneration. Local closeout **339.77s /5.66min**, within original 60min. No training/live match/release, M4 use, other-agent root change, cleanup or deletion. Retain translation experimental; future owner-directed repeat needs idle memory headroom and fresh admission.

Archive members: `source.tar` (reviewed source/protocol/dependencies/source reviews), `timing-plan.json` (input hashes/headers/restoration), `timing/off/` and `timing/on/hands.jsonl.gz`, `native-fixtures.jsonl`, completed off hashes, pre-archive operation resource/log/intent/receipt files, original failure/closeout, count-only partial summaries and archive-only continuation. Archived `partial-summary.json` incorrectly inferred no calibration records; archived `partial-summary-corrected.json` corrected counts but retained the inaccurate “during loading” label and ambiguously named final-zero counts. **The Git final partial receipt/report supersede both**: loading completed, 439 complete calibration records and 0 final hands; interrupted worker duration 117.40s is not isolated loading or per-hand cost. These mistaken snapshots remain preserved, not silently overwritten. Archive-operation mutable logs/final receipt, local closeout completion, final correction/report/review and Drive handoff are compact Git lifecycle receipts after sealing. No incomplete calibration is substituted for the predeclared final sample.

The original on gzip intentionally fails its final-footer integrity check. For forensic count/hash readback only, stream `gzip.open(...,'rt')`, parse complete JSON lines until the documented EOFError, and validate each row's canonical SHA256; keep original bytes. There is no frozen final plan or complete worker cost receipt. Restoration does not authorize another experiment, missing-coordinate completion, reuse as final data or removal. Independent final review and required checks accompanied the initial unmerged handoff. The owner subsequently requested merge after all five checks passed on reviewed head `14de46b215e2f34b2beb320902d679868999f415`; PR218 merged as `31cf2490144581992d0d334d5132daeebfa7918d` at 18:29:15 UTC on October 9, 2026. That authorization supersedes the earlier unmerged instruction. The original playing-comparison goal remains incomplete, translation stays experimental/off by default, and upload acceptance/dependency review/cleanup remains a pending owner/later-agent handoff. No archive bytes, originals or inputs changed for merge.

## PR232 fresh all-40 M4 frozen K50 scoring

The owner requests [PR232](https://github.com/dberweger2017/deepcfr-texas-no-limit-holdem-6-players/pull/232), a separate fresh attempt in branch
`feature/hu20-equity-bench-scoring-m4`, isolated M4 workdir
`/Users/dberweger/Local/hu20-equity-bench-scoring-m4`, fresh main
`5875ecd36bf0b35abeeb718dba2e7b7f4b6765c4`.
[Protocol](docs/hu20-equity-bench-scoring-m4.md),
[final report](docs/reports/hu20-equity-bench-scoring-m4.md).
PR226 explicitly released M4 at 01:09 Madrid October11; own clear admission,
exact restoration and the once-only timing pilot preceded all-40 scoring.
Executed source **d39ece2b00933dd7584daf9ff1ede82773f08241** preserves 23 reviewed
scientific hashes. All 40 roots were newly scored; the nine previously inspected
M1 outcomes are disclosed, so this is not outcome-blind or independent confirmation.
All previous stops and archives remain intact.

Inputs were restored after release into ignored non-synced
`results/equity-bench-scoring-m4-20261010/restored/` with
`python -m scripts.restore_hu20_equity_scoring --base results/equity-bench-scoring-m4-20261010`,
under the explicit M4 operation guard. This command verifies every whole
archive and selected member/alias size and SHA256. It writes exact source
member locators, hashes, restored paths and original modification times into
`BASE/restoration.json`. Input archives are not duplicated in new score bundles:

- #222 exports/adapters/references: Drive `1CloDY_sTImLcn4lffU5OHWQAdT7RLb37`,
  archive SHA256 `c1f305a85282330ef14deadb176a8c97a560f0976fb632e75e387da9e265a8f9`,

  `feec3c2212e7edc7411f4eff1cf1e73745994d8525c749e6aa9b01544dd764a4`.
  Every required model/prepared input and hardlink alias is pinned by
  [the existing member index](docs/reports/hu20-equity-bench-artifacts/model-input-index.json);
  selected `research/references/` and metadata members are verified against the
  accepted manifest. Scoring requires the original corpus/fold hashes.

  in the existing member index and [key report](docs/reports/native-equity-bucket-keys.md).

**Final scoring: pass**, matched K50 − v1 **−0.2038 [−0.2836, −0.1274] BB** and negative 10M point **−0.1853 BB**. Scientific pilot/evaluation/report guards all complete clear; 40 fresh roots, zero reused. The full timing quote was posted before evaluation. A later M4 GitHub HTTP401 stopped the initial archival helper before ZIP creation; its worker-exit log/receipt/latch/helper remain preserved. Separate archival-only closeout used fresh live M1 PR metadata and completed clear; no science retry.

[Acceptance](docs/reports/hu20-equity-bench-scoring-m4-artifacts/final-cloud-upload.json) records native uploaded1/uploading0/paused0/trashed0/conflicts0 with exact size, plus independent Drive ID/name/size/parent and folder-parent confirmation. Remote ZIP bytes were **not downloaded or verified**. No accepted #222 policies/adapters/references, #190 evaluator or #163 tables are duplicated; all 40 canonical prepared request copies are also omitted. `results/equity-bench-scoring-m4-20261010/restoration.json` pins every restored member/alias path, size, SHA256, original mtime and accepted input archive locator. `localization.json` pins compact-path-only replacements; reconstruct them with the indexed restorer plus `python -m scripts.score_restored_hu20_equity_bench prepare --base BASE`. New runtime scoring requests/native outputs remain in the ZIP.

The full frozen summary is archive member `results/equity-bench-scoring-m4-20261010/work/summary.json`; all final raw results/requests/native outputs are under `results/equity-bench-scoring-m4-20261010/work/eval/`. Scientific and administrative failures are retained; final upload/review/cleanup/merge lifecycle records remain compact Git receipts, after the packed report snapshot. Only **305 own extracted input copies** were removed after accepted upload and independent dependency clearance, with immediate exact set/path/size/mtime/SHA256/lsof checks. [Every removed path and restoration locator](docs/reports/hu20-equity-bench-scoring-m4-artifacts/final-cleanup-receipt.json). Score originals, work roots, prior archives and all synced files are retained; historical own symlinks require exact input restoration before reuse.

Restoring this evidence does not authorize another scientific run. Own extracted-copy cleanup is complete as indexed above. The [single final end evidence review](docs/reports/hu20-equity-bench-scoring-m4-artifacts/final-evidence-review.json) is clear, with no open findings. M4 was released at 06:46 Madrid October11; green exact-head merge remains pending. No cleanup of other PRs or synced folders occurred.

### PR238 completed supplemental repair and cleanup authorization

The owner permitted the archival exception, then explicitly authorized finishing everything needed to close PR238 and correct cleanup. Both metadata failures remain preserved; no scientific retry or changed guards/budget. [Closeout ZIP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JOStfz0GZVdMF5FZ85mSon_LkzYNzxP0/view?usp=drivesdk), ID 1JOStfz0GZVdMF5FZ85mSon_LkzYNzxP0, same PR238 folder: **80,534 bytes /27 members**, SHA256 **281cf1677bf441dc913cd40601c55394b3f9636fab219e21620a7ea94a67e88e**, manifest SHA256 **0aa41a6f04f081d047f45f6ad4f384aa44d56c63944c0ffe42ebaaa8b75075b5**. All local member readbacks pass; current native uploaded1/uploading0/conflicts0/not-paused/not-excluded/not-trashed and independent ID/name/size/parent agree. Remote bytes not downloaded. [Acceptance receipt](docs/reports/hu20-k50-5b-first-pass-artifacts/closeout-archive-acceptance.json).

The supplemental archive seals both startup failures, original latch, closed archive guard, owner exception, corrected worker and review provenance. Locally preserved too. Existing indexed input copies have current native+independent archive acceptance, or current pinned release size/digest, without repeated large archive/member audits. [Input cleanup provenance](docs/reports/hu20-k50-5b-first-pass-artifacts/cleanup-input-acceptance.json). After reviewed green-check merge, cleanup targets41 unchanged own payloads /7,514,485,775 bytes; fresh dependency/stat/upload checks remain mandatory. A measured receipt will record every removed path and exact archive/member/hash restoration. Shared Git, guard/budget/failure history, source/environment, compact/changed/unarchived files and synced/other-PR files are protected. The earlier draft hold is superseded by accepted repair and owner authorization; merge awaits final exact-head checks.

## PR250 inactive checkpoint-copy cleanup during PR251 setup — October 13

Current merged PR250, current native full-archive uploaded/no-pending/no-conflicts and independent cloud ID/name/size/parent acceptance admitted removal of six unchanged, singly linked M4 local files after dependency review: **8,983,554,470 bytes**. Each original still matched its recorded path, size and modification history. Terminal average, all tables, code/receipts, shared Git, other PR roots and every synced file remain. PR246 root/uploads are unchanged. [Exact removed paths and restoration](docs/reports/hu100-pot-pressure-artifacts/c-cleanup-receipt.json). Restore each named member from PR250 full archive `1Lrsw5tYJ6lQExmBJpZEQ6xILqOcsVvKW`, whole SHA256 `3cc16676c4c61b896560f463f01617427fa452502ff0a771dfe7985a1e9f2a69`, then require the receipt's member size/SHA256. No remote download or repeat archive/member hash audit was performed. This supersedes originals-retained statements for only the six receipt paths.

Remote archive bytes were **not downloaded or independently hashed**; metadata acceptance and local integrity are separate claims.
- Restore: download the named archive to a fresh ignored nonsynced path as `ARCHIVE.zip`; `shasum -a 256 ARCHIVE.zip` must match the whole hash above. Then `python -c 'import sys,zipfile; zipfile.ZipFile(sys.argv[1]).extract(sys.argv[2],sys.argv[3])' ARCHIVE.zip MEMBER RESTORE_ROOT`; `shasum -a 256 RESTORE_ROOT/MEMBER` must match the full member hash in the linked model index/manifest.

### PR251 local model cleanup recorded in PR252

After current merged-owner status and current native plus independent Drive acceptance of PR251’s full archive were checked, three singly linked unchanged local model copies (path/size/recorded mtime matched manifest) were removed from `~/Local/hu100-pot-pressure-20261013/`: v0.5.2 average, v0.5.1 average and restored K50 average, **5,729,368,451 bytes**. No live A cwd/selected-file dependency existed; B uses its own freshly verified v0.5.0 download. [Receipt and exact member restoration](docs/reports/hu100-roots-per-seat-artifacts/a-cleanup-receipt.json), [dependency wording clarification](docs/reports/hu100-roots-per-seat-artifacts/a-cleanup-clarification.json). Native and independent cloud acceptance was current; remote bytes/downloads and member/hash audits were not repeated for cleanup. A tables/traces/source/receipts, C average/tables, shared Git, PR246 roots/uploads and every synced file were retained. Restore each removed member from PR251’s indexed full ZIP, with exact hashes/commands in the receipt and PR251 model index above.

### PR250 local terminal-average cleanup recorded in PR252

Current merged-owner status, current native accepted upload/no-pending/no-conflicts and independent direct-folder ID/name/size confirmation of PR250’s small averages ZIP permitted removing its unchanged singly linked local terminal average, **2,221,370,011 bytes**, after original path/size/recorded mtime and live-dependency checks. [Cleanup/restoration receipt](docs/reports/hu100-roots-per-seat-artifacts/c-average-cleanup-receipt.json). The file was `~/Local/hu200-k50-first-20261013/results/hu200-k50-first/training/1000000000.average.gz`; it is **752,593,175-node terminal**, not a reached 1B model. Restore `research/training/1000000000.average.gz` from [small ZIP ID `1DMz8kmY4DIQfO-NSIdEiOu9k-tl1hzrB`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DMz8kmY4DIQfO-NSIdEiOu9k-tl1hzrB/view), whole SHA256 `4e6fc9f34b93f8a4e08628e31ba72ebe0b13f08605c02adc62d6354127c33165`; the linked receipt gives full member SHA256 and exact extraction/hash commands. This supersedes C’s dated local-average retention snapshot. Tables, source/receipts, shared Git, PR246 roots/uploads, other worktrees and all synced files remain; no active B input or open PR249 tracked C-model dependency existed. No remote bytes were downloaded or archive/member hash audits repeated for cleanup. Future HU200 evaluation retrieves the accepted small ZIP.
